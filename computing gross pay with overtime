# Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per
# hour to compute gross pay.Write your pay computation to give the employee 1.5
# times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours.
# Make your program handle non-numeric input gracefully by printing an error message
# and exiting the program.
# 1) Enter Hours: 35      (2)  Enter Hours: 45
#    Enter Rate: 2.75          Enter Rate: 10
#    Pay: 96.25                Pay: 475.0
