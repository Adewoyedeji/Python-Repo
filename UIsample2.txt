6/2/19, 22:21 - Kenneth Maths. US.: But the info they are asking i bliv is to track and terrorists or likely terrorist not to make a decision on well meaning applicants
6/2/19, 22:22 - Bootylicious Honeypie: You've forgotten how petty your uncle is🙄
6/2/19, 22:22 - Dee: This will delay application processing times. Going through those social media pages, even for just one person will take time. I don't see how this can be sustained for long.
6/2/19, 22:22 - Bootylicious Honeypie: You may be seen as a terrorist simply for yabbing him
6/2/19, 22:24 - Kenneth Maths. US.: There is a scanner that picks certain words.....they scanned HRC's thousands of emails in less than a week i bliv
6/2/19, 22:43 - Dee: Heard a while back one of their security agencies has a software that tracks certain words on the web. "Bomb" "terrorist" etc. That makes sense. 

But you would have to be a very dumb terrorist or one that village people are still in touch with, to put your criminal activities on your social media platform. 

As to who hates trump or yabbs trump publicly, they will deny visas tire till the word "deny" starts coming out of their asses . Cos I am pretty sure 95% of sane people in the world either hates him, can't stand him, or think trump stupid.

You just may get a 10 year Visa by promising, on your social media feed, to go bitch slap the guy if you ever get into the US. 
Just to give you enough time to actually get it done.

6/3/19, 14:59 - Dee: 😃You just reminded me of another, quite interesting dicussion we had once on another group. Let me ask you ladies and gents here these questions. 

1. Why is it that in Nigeria, only pregnant women ( and only while pregnant)  know anything  about sex or anything related to it. Once the baby is born, boom we develop amnesia with ZERO knowledge of it. 
2. Why is it that some couples willingly tell their friends about their fantasies but form amnesia/ prim and proper when talking to their spouses? Then later complain things are stale in their marriages? 
3. Why is that some men will restrict what their wives can wear in public but go after same clothing in young girls then complain their wives are no longer looking sexy?
I have searched for answers to these questions for a while now.  Maybe I will get a satisfactory answer here today.
6/3/19, 15:01 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: My data don finish I for ansa u

6/3/19, 15:11 - Bootylicious Honeypie: I support the statement before the first fullstop
6/3/19, 15:11 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
6/3/19, 15:14 - Dee: Benedict , Kenneth, Ini, maryann, eugene, smart, Ehi,  you cannot hide. 
I really want to know. Let's leave holy for a few minutes. Every one here spent at least 4 long years in university, studying some of the hardest courses in the world and passed with flying colours. These simple questions can't be that hard to answer na.
6/3/19, 15:17 - Dee: I support too.
6/3/19, 15:22 - Dee: If I will get answers to my questions, we shall host. But you may get more questions than you bargained for. And you wont be able to hide behind finished data.
6/3/19, 15:23 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Maybe they are still busy at work😁
6/3/19, 15:24 - Dee: I know. That is why I mentioned their names so they see it when they close. No dodging
6/3/19, 15:25 - +234 908 620 7535: 🎼🎤I am married to Jesus, satan leave me alone! 🎧

6/3/19, 15:25 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Thank God nobody is satan here💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼
6/3/19, 15:25 - Dee: Even Jesus answered questions. Oya,....

6/3/19, 15:28 - +234 803 072 5702: Pls what’s today’s date?...this amnesia ish...🙃
6/3/19, 15:28 - Dee: The way we treat/demonise any sex related question in Nigeria makes one think only pregnant women have sex.
6/3/19, 15:28 - Bootylicious Honeypie: You too?😲😲😲
6/3/19, 15:29 - Bootylicious Honeypie: People are falling my hand big time
6/3/19, 15:29 - Dee: 😃 so, in other words, one can induce amnesia bah?
6/3/19, 15:29 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Are you even sure pregnant women in Nigeria have sex?
6/3/19, 15:30 - Dee: 🤣🤣 sorry my mistake
6/3/19, 15:30 - +234 803 072 5702: 🤣
6/3/19, 15:34 - Benedict: 😂😂
6/3/19, 15:35 - +234 802 971 7134: I’m learning o
6/3/19, 15:36 - Benedict: I really want to answer these questions, really i do.
6/3/19, 15:36 - Bootylicious Honeypie: But...? Cos I sense a "but" coming
6/3/19, 15:37 - Dee: Oya talk jare. Judgement free zone
6/3/19, 15:37 - Benedict: 😂
6/3/19, 15:38 - +234 908 620 7535: Aswear, this is a valid kweshun 🤣
6/3/19, 15:39 - Benedict: I think the answer to all the questions is our sense of "fake" modesty enforced by our strong sense of religion (which is somewhat fake too in my opinion)
6/3/19, 15:40 - Benedict: we now put all of these under the umbrella of culture
6/3/19, 15:40 - +234 908 620 7535: I'm pretty sure my parents have never had sex, including that time my last brother cane 7yrs after the one before him. How could they? My mother was too busy as charismatic prayer warrior
6/3/19, 15:40 - Bootylicious Honeypie: What was it Oby said again?🤔   "we are not spiritual in this country...only very silly"🤣🤣🤣
6/3/19, 15:40 - Benedict: i agree
6/3/19, 15:41 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Gbam! They probably pray led your brother into existence! Miracle!
6/3/19, 15:41 - Bootylicious Honeypie: *prayed
6/3/19, 15:42 - Bootylicious Honeypie: This is true
6/3/19, 15:42 - Benedict: the default answer would have been culture. Our culture frowns at these things but the truth is that our pre-western religion cultures were very liberal o.
Nudity was nothing, sex was a community project
6/3/19, 15:43 - +234 908 620 7535: 😂 if I didn't know better, I'd say someone is campaigning for the good old days
6/3/19, 15:44 - Benedict: Like what do u call people waiting at the door of a newly married couples house to confirm that they are nacking well 😉
6/3/19, 15:44 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Grading?🤔
6/3/19, 15:45 - +234 908 620 7535: You people should leave me oh! I have assignment for today 🤣

6/3/19, 15:47 - Dee: Hmm, this is quite detailed. I actually agree with this. To the letter. But let's see if others can even enlighten us further.
6/3/19, 15:47 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Was that how Jidenna came to be?😲
6/3/19, 15:48 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Yes na, mountain top tins 40 days

6/3/19, 15:49 - +234 802 971 7134: But me and my guys are volleyballers
6/3/19, 15:49 - +234 908 620 7535: We are not wired anything. This thing is perpetuated by an warped desire to be holier than thou. I believe it is changing small small with our generation asking interesting questions like our curious Dee right here
6/3/19, 15:50 - Bootylicious Honeypie: The words ain't coming out right anymore o...hmmmm...🤔🤔🤔
6/3/19, 15:50 - +234 802 971 7134: I don’t think so. The general NFCS group as a case study
6/3/19, 15:50 - Ini Eket: These two words... Rise and Prez... 🤔
6/3/19, 15:51 - +234 908 620 7535: It's called speaking in tongues, dear Judy
6/3/19, 15:51 - Ini Eket: 🏃 🏃
6/3/19, 15:51 - +234 802 971 7134: Our generation might be worse
6/3/19, 15:51 - Bootylicious Honeypie: And he said it!👏🏻👏🏻🙈👏🏻👏🏻

6/3/19, 15:51 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Ok thanks
6/3/19, 15:52 - Bootylicious Honeypie: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
6/3/19, 15:52 - +234 908 620 7535: 🤣
6/3/19, 15:53 - Dee: 🤣🤣I will like to know what they are called
6/3/19, 15:54 - Ini Eket: She said it all 😁
6/3/19, 15:55 - Benedict: By the way, @2348126296642 the number 2 part of ur question is hard o. Even in more liberal climes, izz hard o.
At the end, it sha comes down to communication and marrying someone who has similar inclinations.
6/3/19, 15:55 - Bootylicious Honeypie: They are graders, grading how well the new couple is doing.🤷🏼‍♀
6/3/19, 15:55 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Why is it hard?
6/3/19, 15:56 - Bootylicious Honeypie: How do you know you have similar inclinations?
6/3/19, 15:56 - Dee: 😃 u will still talk by force
6/3/19, 15:56 - Benedict: thats the communication part naa
6/3/19, 15:56 - Dee: Yes o. Na we born pass
6/3/19, 15:57 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Its cos you said "marrying someone with similar inclinations"... sounded like it's when you have similar inclinations that you can then talk about it...
6/3/19, 15:58 - +234 802 971 7134: That’s why I don’t talk. Cos I go dey fight everyday. Mans not got time for that
6/3/19, 15:58 - Bootylicious Honeypie: But it is in talking about it that you realise you have similar inclinations...n'est pas?
6/3/19, 15:59 - Benedict: but communication sef get levels. There are things i tell people i dicuss with my wife that makes them look at me like "is this one normal?" At the same time, i know a couple that do and say things to each other that makes me say "are these ones normal"
6/3/19, 15:59 - Benedict: i meant communicate first then identify the similar inclinations
6/3/19, 16:00 - Bootylicious Honeypie: I think sometimes, between couples...theres that fear not to appear "so bad". So we would rather keep such fantasies ro ourselves...maybe cos we ourselves see those fantasies as evil
6/3/19, 16:01 - Benedict: this one sef dey.
6/3/19, 16:02 - Benedict: the conditioning is deep mehn
6/3/19, 16:02 - Dee: But you are not submitting the assignment today na. So time dey. Oya give answer
6/3/19, 16:02 - +234 908 620 7535: Based on foundational conditioning and coding aka church/mosque upbringing
6/3/19, 16:03 - +234 908 620 7535: Uncle facilitator, use this talent to be making money na 😃
6/3/19, 16:04 - +234 802 971 7134: My wife and I discuss them o. I think once there’s underlying trust there’s no shaking
6/3/19, 16:04 - +234 802 971 7134: We have fantasies we have lived out and more incoming
6/3/19, 16:04 - Dee: Yes o. We shall forever continue  to ask. I agree with you. We have the side we show to the world. Which is usually very different from who we really are.
6/3/19, 16:04 - Benedict: even those of us that think we have overcome the conditioning, na lie. Deep inside of us, we are still well conditioned.
6/3/19, 16:05 - +234 802 971 7134: Like we want to join the mile high club
6/3/19, 16:05 - Benedict: i forget what this means
6/3/19, 16:05 - +234 802 971 7134: Ask Deji
6/3/19, 16:05 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Oshey!
6/3/19, 16:05 - +234 908 620 7535: But bro, I really have no field experience to draw from in this regard oh. True talk. I have neva been pregnant, neither have I been married. As far as I am aware sha. I don't think I did in the dream world 🤔
6/3/19, 16:06 - Benedict: abeg, allow my selective amnesia kick in quietly
6/3/19, 16:06 - +234 802 971 7134: Ok na
6/3/19, 16:06 - Dee: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
6/3/19, 16:07 - +234 802 971 7134: None of these apply to me. Kenneth for example is the arena king
6/3/19, 16:08 - +234 908 620 7535: In other news, I really cannot focus today oh! I'm going to see Hugh Jackman live today 💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼
The Man. The Music. The Show 😎
6/3/19, 16:09 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Guys seem to be overlooking question 3
6/3/19, 16:09 - Benedict: Cool
6/3/19, 16:10 - Bootylicious Honeypie: 👍🏻
6/3/19, 16:10 - Benedict: make i come?
6/3/19, 16:10 - +234 802 971 7134: I want my wife to look good for me and have no issues whatsoever
6/3/19, 16:10 - Bootylicious Honeypie: 👊🏻
6/3/19, 16:10 - +234 802 971 7134: And those that know me well know
6/3/19, 16:10 - +234 908 620 7535: Please come. I need someone to take my pictures 😃
6/3/19, 16:11 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Would it be ok for her to dress same way if you probably travelled alone on a trip?
6/3/19, 16:11 - +234 802 971 7134: I don’t quite get the question
6/3/19, 16:12 - Bootylicious Honeypie: You like her to look good for you when you are around...what about when you are not around?
6/3/19, 16:13 - +234 908 620 7535: I've given up pretending to work. There's no point today has ended
6/3/19, 16:14 - Bootylicious Honeypie: I recall once when I was still taking French classes. I went to do my usual runs of dropping off the kids in school before going to school. I got to Xanders creche and one of his minders asked  if my husband was back. I said he wasnt. Next thing was " will he be ok with how you are dressed? Ah you know hes not around o. Other men will be looking"
6/3/19, 16:14 - +234 802 971 7134: Of course any and every time.  Maybe slightly better even when I’m not around so I get back to very spicy
6/3/19, 16:14 - +234 802 971 7134: Did you slap him?
6/3/19, 16:15 - +234 908 620 7535: So,
Question 1: I agree with Dwit. False sense of 'decency' complicated by religious 'holiness' and consideration of sexual and carnal desires as sinful unless for the purpose of procreation. Interestingly, Christian faith does not even teach this. Not sure about Islam
6/3/19, 16:15 - Bootylicious Honeypie: I didnt know when I literally looked at myself from head to toe to see what was wrong with what I was wearing.  Just my regular leggings,boots and a top. Very sane wear!. I just said hes fine with it and left
6/3/19, 16:15 - Dee: Let me tell u a true life story. 
I have 2 friends. Married. Lady is free spirited. True to herself. Dude not so much. Lady sometimes mentions things she would like to do, places she would like to go to but dude will refuse. We all just concluded dude is different. One day, dude had a too much to drink and started talking. Was shocked. I then asked why he hasnt done all that with lady. Said he doesn't want lady to see him negatively. But that is what lady wants to do. She is also scared dude will term her evil. 
True life story
6/3/19, 16:16 - Bootylicious Honeypie: It was a her🤣🤣🤣. One felt I was "looking too fine" to go out with hubby not around. Others said she should free me. ...🙂
6/3/19, 16:17 - +234 802 971 7134: You should have asked her for charcoal to rub on your face
6/3/19, 16:17 - +234 802 971 7134: As your husband is not around
6/3/19, 16:17 - Dee: 😃 this is true
6/3/19, 16:18 - +234 908 620 7535: Question 2: insecurity is the biggest driver in my opinion. Insecurity and fear of rejection. I mean, if na dating things, you can say she will break up with you. If na marriage, at least una don confirm to the whole world say una dey knack so wetin remain. 
Trust may be another one
6/3/19, 16:20 - Bootylicious Honeypie: I think they have gotten used to me now🙂.
6/3/19, 16:20 - Benedict: lols. i can imagine.
6/3/19, 16:21 - +234 908 620 7535: Question 3: craze is what is worrying the men. They are not normal niyen.

Also, religious/societal conditioning could be at fault. In europe back in the day, you had decent sex with you wife, she dressed proper and look dignified as a married woman. Then you go outside to get the fantasies you seek. Naija too will move past this foolishness in time.

But mainly, craze is worrying the man/men. Taink you
6/3/19, 16:21 - Bootylicious Honeypie: That's usually the case unfortunately
6/3/19, 16:22 - +234 802 971 7134: My lifelong dream is to rearrange my wife. If not why did I marry her?
6/3/19, 16:23 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Funny that a lot of so called modern men are guilty of this
6/3/19, 16:27 - Bootylicious Honeypie: I remember speaking once with a married friend. She saw a dress online...fine sexy outfit. Even I felt it was a bit too much. She said she loved it and would love to be able to put it on...especially for her husband.  Now I know her husband to love pretty little things in a short skirt...
I then said maybe she should get it and put it on...at least her hubby will like it and all that. Her shocking response was lai Lai o! He will never accept! That if she even wears a sleeveless top he would ask her to change that he cant have other men looking at his wife's arms...

Me I was just looking shocked like huh?😲
6/3/19, 16:28 - +234 802 971 7134: That one is mad
6/3/19, 16:29 - +234 908 620 7535: With these few point of mine, and Judy's sample case study, I hope that... 😄
6/3/19, 16:29 - +234 908 620 7535: Yaba left suppose don full if there was a fully functional madness detector
6/3/19, 16:30 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Shes never gone clubbing with her hubby...yet Friday nights are his best days of the week.
I had always thought she was the very "holy" one...but I realised shes very very sane and interesting and longs to be interesting for and with her husband...but her husband man would never allow that! WHY?!!!
6/3/19, 16:30 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Lol
6/3/19, 16:30 - +234 908 620 7535: Heat will be disturbing my ministry, I will now wear suit bcos my husband does not want other men to look at my arms. Odiegwu!
6/3/19, 16:32 - Bootylicious Honeypie: The fact that she obeys tells you how much she wants to please him. Like shes so particular about being that "hawt wifey" for him...but for some reason he feels shes too scared for that🤷🏼‍♀
6/3/19, 16:32 - +234 908 620 7535: Wait oh, I'm the only unmarried kangaroo in this group. Izz like I shu comman be going 🚶🏽‍♀😁
6/3/19, 16:32 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Hehehehehehe.....
6/3/19, 16:32 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Are you just noticing?🤣🤣🤣
6/3/19, 16:33 - +234 908 620 7535: That one is a colonial master oh. Chief conqueror, women affair division
6/3/19, 16:34 - +234 908 620 7535: Nne, ayam just noticing. I actually went and scrolled through group members 😄
6/3/19, 16:34 - Bootylicious Honeypie: So far only CY seems cool with wifey looking "interesting"🙂. I wonder what other men think
6/3/19, 16:35 - Benedict: yup, only him. Noone looks at my wife 😡 Only me.
6/3/19, 16:35 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Why?
6/3/19, 16:35 - Benedict: 🤣🤣🤣. Felt weird typing that.
6/3/19, 16:36 - +234 908 620 7535: How Eugene wan talk, when Omo don already declare 50 days prayer, fasting and abstinence for their 2nd born? 😂
6/3/19, 16:36 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Am really interested.
6/3/19, 16:36 - Benedict: Me that i'm finding toasters for her. My theory is that "The beauty of a woman is directly proportional to the number of toasters she has"
6/3/19, 16:37 - Benedict: 😂😂
6/3/19, 16:37 - Dee: Yeah I believe you are on to something here. Maybe we see it as evil so we fear others may see us as evil if we display such
6/3/19, 16:37 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Lol. After rize-ing and prez-ing shey?😁
6/3/19, 16:37 - Dee: Yep. I think this is a major reason for it.
6/3/19, 16:38 - Bootylicious Honeypie: So...something is wrong if toasters ain't plenty bah?👍🏻
6/3/19, 16:38 - +234 908 620 7535: You have to rize to prez, my dear sister 😁
6/3/19, 16:39 - Dee: 😃 I wish o.

6/3/19, 16:40 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Too bad the sample size in this group is small...
6/3/19, 16:40 - Dee: I think this is true too.
6/3/19, 16:40 - Dee: 😃 we must be related somehow.
6/3/19, 16:40 - +234 908 620 7535: Judy, if your carry this thing go fam page, na sir Gilly go first give you uppercut
6/3/19, 16:41 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Am kuku looking for how to lose small weight before😁
6/3/19, 16:41 - Dee: 🤣🤣🤣 sharap my friend.  You know what it means
6/3/19, 16:42 - Bootylicious Honeypie: This kind of gist is not allowed there though. Abi?
6/3/19, 16:43 - Dee: 😃 still you must have an opinion about it one way or another. You own is still good na. Atleast you admit you may not have experience in that area. Havent you heard of people that have never had boyfriends or girlfriends telling married couples how to live their lives? Probabaly from books they have read or from what men of God told them. That table has many people on it.
6/3/19, 16:44 - +234 908 620 7535: I think you should go and post it. I'm interested in conducting a study on how many priests will be referred to your door for private deliverance
6/3/19, 16:44 - Dee: No amnesia allowed here o.

6/3/19, 16:47 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Number 3 n0 he issue for my side o. In fact my own dey complain say some of my skirt and short knickers too long. E dey also complain say my palazzo too free
6/3/19, 16:48 - Dee: This is what even some liberal men can't take. Some dressings are ok when they around but not ok when they are not around. This is another dicussion we shall talk about hia😁
6/3/19, 16:48 - Bootylicious Honeypie: You sef...the name is SHORT knickers nah🙄

6/3/19, 16:51 - Dee: If only they knew the kind of things I like seeing on you.
6/3/19, 16:52 - Dee: Totally agree.

6/3/19, 17:06 - Dee: 😃 I like how you think. Better to ask for forgiveness than permission. POST IT. I support. If it will blow up let it blow up.
6/3/19, 17:06 - Bootylicious Honeypie: But you know sometimes...the ladies decide not to dress all sexy sometimes...so that their spouses dont begin to look at them somehow or think about them in a certain way...

6/3/19, 17:09 - Dee: Ok great. We may get an answer for this one and learn some things
6/3/19, 17:10 - Dee: 🤣 hijab or not, we r all brains, flesh and blood.  And most times, flesh and blood conspire against brain.
6/3/19, 17:11 - Dee: I have heard this argument before too. They guy isn't complaining about their dressing. But lady is scared guy may see her as not "wife material"

6/3/19, 17:57 - Dee: So we have different answers for 1 & 2, mostly the same from different people and a possible "craze" reason for 3 ( which I will most certainly put up in another group if this discussion ever comes up again). Maybe 3 requires a bit more research. 
I believe 3 is the one that affects homes the most. I know some guys  just do not like certain types of things. But for the rest, I believe if we men allow her partners to wear those same things we find attractive on other women ( wigs, studs, short things, tattoos,  ankle chain, make up, etc) our partners may become more attractive than those other ladies.

7/18/19, 19:05 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
7/18/19, 19:10 - Benedict: 🤣🤣
7/18/19, 19:24 - Dee: So the problem with this is timing. People go on vacation different times of the year as their work or kids school permits. 

We know when kids go on  long break here in Nigeria. July to september. Not sure about other parts of the world. But that could be a good  travel time if it's the same in other parts of the world. 

Now we just need to focus on everyone getting their leaves around the same period that frees everyone for 2 to 3 weeks.  Some are on equal time rotation ( e.g 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off. Or 4 weeks on, 4 weeks off. Or 6 weeks on, 6 weeks off)  while others are full time and  take leave once a year.
Meaning those with leave once a year could time their leave  to co incide with the off times of those on rotations. 

Once we come up with a time frame that favours everyone,( even if it's just 1 week where everyone can be off work),we then push it to next year to allow everyone save for the trip. 

While we are waiting for the day to arrive , we discuss where to go, where to stay and activities to do.
7/18/19, 19:26 - Bootylicious Honeypie: 💋💋
7/18/19, 19:39 - Dee: Any other ideas on how to get everyone to be free at the same time.?
7/18/19, 20:30 - Kenneth Maths. US.: This makws sense..... on this side of the world, kids are usually off school somewhere from June till about 2nd week in August
7/18/19, 20:31 - Kenneth Maths. US.: *Makes*
7/18/19, 20:33 - Dee: So this gives us mid July to mid August to travel.
7/18/19, 20:36 - Dee: Anyone with any reason why this period is a bad time to travel?
7/18/19, 20:37 - Bootylicious Honeypie: 2020 bah?
7/18/19, 20:37 - Benedict: It has to be.
7/18/19, 20:38 - Benedict: Higher flight costs 🙈😂
7/18/19, 20:38 - Dee: Yeah
7/18/19, 20:40 - Dee: True that. Omo, can anything be done about this to bring the cost down? Since this seems to be one period we can get everyone off work.
7/18/19, 20:41 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Aren't there usually packages that period?
7/18/19, 20:41 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Plus it depends on where we choose to go to I guess
7/18/19, 20:42 - Dee: Yeah I think so. 
Omo, do you know of such packages this period ?
7/18/19, 20:44 - Benedict: I think the next question is destinations. US is out of it, @14692437489 and @2348029717134 sorry. But uncle Trump no want us again. My Visa expires in January and I ain't got no plans to apply for renewal.
7/18/19, 20:45 - Benedict: Europe trip? 😁, Asia ? 🤔
7/18/19, 20:45 - Dee: Just remembered something. I think most schools go on break for like 3 weeks december to January period. Depending on the place we want to visit, there may he packages for this period  as well. 
That is if it's the same  in other parts of the world.
7/18/19, 20:47 - Benedict: Ermm... Winter? Na Dubai be that. Or Australian Outbacks😂
7/18/19, 20:47 - Dee: Dubai.
7/18/19, 20:47 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Some people cannot stand cold o🤣🤣🤣
7/18/19, 20:47 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Ehem...they haff expose themselves 🤣🤣🤣
7/18/19, 20:48 - Benedict: I full this table 😂
7/18/19, 20:48 - Bootylicious Honeypie: You and Ini
7/18/19, 20:48 - Dee: 😀 yeah could work too. Lots of activities to do. Cheap 4 star hotels. Etc.
7/18/19, 20:48 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Make una dey use freezer practice for house
7/18/19, 20:54 - Dee: Pending when imo replies, any other problems with the mid July to mid August dates,other than the one benedict raised? 

Also of it's the same in other parts of the world, then we may have two possible travel  dates. 

1. Mid July to Mid Aug
2. Mid Dec to Mid Jan
7/18/19, 20:55 - Dee: We just won't go to cold places if we choose number 2
7/18/19, 20:59 - Kenneth Maths. US.: We don't care.....our passport can go almost everywhere without a visa🙈
7/18/19, 20:59 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Errmmm...early january. Schools usually resume around 6th/7th ...or the monday around that time
7/18/19, 20:59 - +234 802 474 1100: Presently busy spiking on the volley ball court...

Mid-July to Aug would seem the most plausible
7/18/19, 21:00 - Dee: Ghen ghen something. That makes you flexible then. Good stuff.
7/18/19, 21:00 - Kenneth Maths. US.: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
7/18/19, 21:00 - +234 802 474 1100: Plus... the cruises sound like the most fun... with this Kenneth pictures all over the internet... Me I am for cruising rather than one location visits
7/18/19, 21:01 - Dee: True that. Unless we choose to come back before then
7/18/19, 21:01 - Dee: A definite vote for mid July to mid August
7/18/19, 21:01 - Kenneth Maths. US.: ...But the money🙈
7/18/19, 21:02 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Believe me it is....and as a group i hear it could be more fun
7/18/19, 21:03 - Dee: Trump is the sand in that cruise garri parole.
7/18/19, 21:04 - +234 802 474 1100: all those carribean islands no need stopover for US na.. abi?
7/18/19, 21:04 - Bootylicious Honeypie: We can leave from other places tight? Not just the US
7/18/19, 21:04 - Dee: Its next year o. Not this year. That gives time to save for it
7/18/19, 21:06 - Dee: Yeah but I believe most start from somewhere in the US and end somewhere in the US. Right?
7/18/19, 21:06 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Anyway I should have my visa before summer next year
7/18/19, 21:06 - Ini Eket: Theres also usually a break around Easter, March/April. Dont knw if its applicable outside Nigeria also
7/18/19, 21:07 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Its a tiny window...2-3 weeks
7/18/19, 21:07 - Dee: I am not sure. Will have to Google it. All the ones I know leave from merritt island or miami in d US.
7/18/19, 21:08 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Saw one from dubai once I think
7/18/19, 21:08 - Dee: If commander in tweet doesn't win again sha
7/18/19, 21:08 - Ini Eket: Is this a high/higher risk activity? My risk tolerance is relatively low nowadays 😁
Kindly explain what it entails
7/18/19, 21:09 - +234 802 474 1100: Not sure... see a couple that start and end in Europe
7/18/19, 21:10 - Dee: The whole vacation will be 2 to 3 weeks right? So it could still work. If we can get any 2 weeks or 3 weeks I the year, that works for everyone , then we will be fine
7/18/19, 21:10 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Bros...let me check your calendar for you first
7/18/19, 21:11 - Dee: Oh really? Didn't know about it. Will google that.
7/18/19, 21:11 - Ini Eket: Same here, visa renewal may be suspended a while till things normalize.
Came in for a 1 week workshop past weekend and was stamped in till July 31
7/18/19, 21:11 - Kenneth Maths. US.: No sir....not in FL maybe in CO though cos we are not united in the United States

7/18/19, 21:19 - +234 802 474 1100: Friend who eventually went said she loved it... and I trust her taste
7/18/19, 21:23 - Dee: Oh ok. A Mediterranean cruise.
7/18/19, 21:26 - Dee: That is approximately 2.35Million for the cruise alone right? Assuming the room comes with everything else
7/18/19, 21:28 - Dee: Kenneth, How does this compare, price wise to the one you did? Cheaper or more expensive?
7/18/19, 21:30 - +234 908 620 7535: 🤣🤣🤣🤣 na now I dey read everything dey laugh. Commander in twee and stars not united got me

7/18/19, 21:33 - Benedict: So I can finally take Santorini pishures 😂😂
7/18/19, 21:33 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Yes o we are not.....don't let them deceive u, each state is its own country
7/18/19, 21:33 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Just adding to the places u know in yankee
7/18/19, 21:34 - Kenneth Maths. US.: 12nights? Abeg is there no 5 or 7 days max?
7/18/19, 21:34 - +234 908 620 7535: Actually, the greek islands is an amazing cruise oh. Island hopping alone is fun. And Greece is cheaper than most European countries
7/18/19, 21:34 - Kenneth Maths. US.: The fewer the # of days the cheaper for people like me🙈
7/18/19, 21:36 - Dee: 😀I have said it before, I want to be like you when I grow up.
7/18/19, 21:36 - Kenneth Maths. US.: This one na die o....almost $6k for 2 pipu o
7/18/19, 21:38 - Kenneth Maths. US.: We had a 3/4 days and it was about $1600 unto say it was late planning
7/18/19, 21:38 - Dee: 😀 no wonder. Cos I checked for MSC seaside once and it was waaaaay cheaper than that.
7/18/19, 21:38 - Kenneth Maths. US.: See levels😁
7/18/19, 21:38 - Dee: Oh ok.
7/18/19, 21:39 - Dee: 7 days is actually good. If you get to make a few stops and spend some time on land
7/18/19, 21:43 - Dee: Oh ok. Dont know much about these islands. Will google them
7/18/19, 21:44 - Dee: 😁 the cheaper it is for everyone
7/18/19, 21:50 - Dee: But wait o. Are we all agreed for  mid July to mid August next year? Apart from the cost of ticket during that period
7/18/19, 22:06 - Bootylicious Honeypie: https://www.msccruises.ca/search-result
7/18/19, 22:16 - Kenneth Maths. US.: @2348024741100 was that cost really in GBP?  Cos what i just saw with @2348025838458's link is quite better (maybe not necessarily the same stops but the same # of days)
7/18/19, 22:17 - Bootylicious Honeypie: There are so many ports to pick from in the link I sent. There are cruises across the Mediterranean,  Caribbean,  oriental...etc
7/18/19, 22:18 - Bootylicious Honeypie: https://www.msccruises.ca/
7/18/19, 22:25 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Also if we are doing a cruise, irrespective of where it is from, check to see that they have drinks o......the one we just got back from had *free open bar* you can drink from like 7am to midnight and of course whatever kind of drink you wanted them to mix for you (that was the part i loved most😁)
7/18/19, 22:26 - Bootylicious Honeypie: <Media omitted>
7/18/19, 22:26 - Bootylicious Honeypie: It could be any cruise o! Me I am just looking at this one
7/18/19, 22:29 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Yea i know.....me i am just particular about free shayo 😁
7/18/19, 22:29 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Lol...your department
7/18/19, 22:30 - Kenneth Maths. US.: You know it all madam😁
7/18/19, 22:30 - Bootylicious Honeypie: 🙌🏻🙌🏻
7/18/19, 22:41 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Volleyball don close...ehen
7/18/19, 22:43 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: So yes July to Aug is expensive time...way to avoid high fare is to buy early or when  promos are running. Promos will usually run after every high season. So after summer travel...Sept to Nov, after xmas travel Feb to May
7/18/19, 22:44 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Very expensive cruises are cheap when bought way in advance, so we can buy a cruise for next year from now. It also means you can pay monthly like contribution
7/18/19, 22:44 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: I recommend a European or Asian destinations as the Visa no get wall of jericho/Mexico around am
7/18/19, 22:45 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Unfortunately that's school time for kids😔
7/18/19, 22:46 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: for which country?
7/18/19, 22:47 - Bootylicious Honeypie: What happened if plans change? Will they give us back the money we have paid?😁
7/18/19, 22:47 - Bootylicious Honeypie: The country I am in...Nigeria
7/18/19, 22:47 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: there is usually a period for cancellation
7/18/19, 22:48 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: ahn ahn, na american school? schools close july till sept na
7/18/19, 22:48 - Bootylicious Honeypie: *happens
7/18/19, 22:49 - Bootylicious Honeypie: By 2nd monday in September schools resume. You mentioned sept till november...
7/18/19, 22:50 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: no I mean promos should be available during that period
7/18/19, 22:51 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Yeah...and that period the children will be in school...so it may be useless in the end
7/18/19, 22:51 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Feb-May also is smack in the middle of 2nd term
7/18/19, 22:53 - Bootylicious Honeypie: But the very first week in september may then be the only window...if going by promo.
But I think uncle Kenneth said their own school resume by August 🤷🏼‍♀
7/18/19, 22:54 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Meaning that is the time to buy the ticket not to travel
7/18/19, 22:55 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: What I mean is during promo period, we can try to buy ticket for the July travel if the dates are not blacked out
7/18/19, 22:55 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Ok...buy it in Sept-Nov...when do we move?
7/18/19, 22:56 - Kenneth Maths. US.: And u can always get insurance on ur ticket for a minimal fee i bliv
7/18/19, 22:57 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Alright then.
7/18/19, 23:08 - Bootylicious Honeypie: My bad. Am mixing up 2 different things together. E ma binu
7/19/19, 05:02 - Dee: Wow una try o. You people were still awake till past 11? . By that time, I was already dreaming I was on a vacation somewhere in the Caribbean, holding a voodoo doll of the commander in tweet, and sticking it with  long needles in places not meant for anything sharp.
7/19/19, 05:07 - Dee: How many weeks in advance minimum should we buy the tickets to get it cheap? I know my company screams at us when we don't submit travel request 3 weeks or more in advance.  They always say anything less than 3 weeks makes the ticket prices high. But that travels agency hikes everything anyway so their idea of cheap ticket is normal people's I-no-be-dangote kind of ticket.
7/19/19, 05:08 - Dee: You mean you can pay the cruise company monthly or the travel agency organising it monthly?
7/19/19, 05:19 - Dee: 👍🏽
7/19/19, 05:20 - Dee: 😀 oshe!!.
7/19/19, 05:22 - Kenneth Maths. US.: After Spiking, yes
7/19/19, 05:23 - Dee: O kare lai. I know say you go still dey awake.
7/19/19, 05:23 - Kenneth Maths. US.: How will u consider ur company and use them as a base line for we middle class?
7/19/19, 05:24 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Lol.....na sleep get me now
7/19/19, 05:28 - Dee: Even upper class gan dey raise eyebrow at the price when Carlson wagonlit issues ticket. Who are we to even speak their name?
7/19/19, 05:29 - Dee: You need a Nuru massage. Will knock you right off.
7/19/19, 08:00 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Hahaha, the reason for the shout is that chances are the flight still has a lot of seats available hence low cost. Once u hear things like 2 seats left, na highest bidder no ni. Not to deny that sometimes u get a fantastic price the night b4 ur trip if the flight is still empty and dey are begging people to come and fill d space
7/19/19, 08:34 - Dee: Oh right.
7/19/19, 09:28 - Bootylicious Honeypie: If we ever consider a Weekend getaway for 3 coupes in Ghana. Like a mini Big Brother House😁

We can get the 3 bedroom penthouse at Kwarleyz residence at 194k per couple.

Flight ticket ( max per couple) is about N220k...thereabout

Total price per couple about N414k (of course there will be extras) 

Friday night clubbing.  Satuday we explore the town a bit, probably go to aqua safari resort do a boat ride, jetski ; feed the fishes etc. Check out on sunday

There’s a belief that Obama enabled Buhari’s election with his misyarning in 2015. And there’s the Nnamdi Kanu angle who continues to feed dem the stories that Trump will help actualize Biafra. He has been to one of two Trump rallies. So it’s not a surprise if you see people marching for Trump there

11/7/20, 18:13 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Abeg, everyone in naija who voted for Buhari, especially the older generation who knew better, should siddon and take their L in peace

11/8/20, 00:55 - +234 802 971 7134: And you know say madness Dey always cook. This one own fit never done finish
11/8/20, 00:55 - Dee: I have read many things in the past few days.  All centered around Religion and Trump. I thought I had seen all shades of stupid, but i realized this past few days, that i haven't even scratched the surface yet. 

I know, in this country especially, we are a deeply religious nation and anything that challenges our beliefs tends to make us shut down and become aggressive and insulting, but permit me to say this. 

The greatest problem we have in this country and possibly, worldwide,  is religion. We need to completely cancel religion for like 3 months. 

So people won't have a choice but to use their heads and come to the realization that it is not a crime to think logically.  

Once we do that, we then bring religion back, and hope that people can now practice religion, with the newly acquired "sense"  to know when a man of God is trying to deceive them.

11/8/20, 01:48 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Imagine that
11/8/20, 07:05 - Dee: 😀 probably won't see the irony.
11/8/20, 09:29 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): I'm beginning to think the demons have won this one's soul oh! Fee for godparent??? End time is here indeed 😂
11/8/20, 14:29 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: It’s for inconveniences like hiding our statues when Kenneth is coming over🤣

11/12/20, 16:47 - +234 802 474 1100: highly unlikely in my opinion
11/12/20, 16:47 - +234 802 971 7134: Differences are pretty wide
11/12/20, 16:48 - +234 802 474 1100: The multiple states, and combination of same with which Biden achieves the magic number as well as the considerable lead in those states
11/12/20, 16:48 - Kenneth Maths. US.: It will
11/12/20, 16:49 - +234 802 474 1100: I read an article today that suggested that one way Trump could still win was to get the state delegates to betray their state results in december when certification time comes
11/12/20, 16:49 - Kenneth Maths. US.: It will bring the 2nd surprise to Trump.....defeated the 2nd time🤣🤣🤣
11/12/20, 16:50 - +234 802 971 7134: They will certify first then the electors will assign the votes
11/12/20, 16:54 - +234 802 474 1100: Yes. There are apparently cases of electors going against the wishes of their states... Renegade shit
11/12/20, 16:55 - Kenneth Maths. US.: That will be very difficult in this case though
11/12/20, 16:55 - +234 802 474 1100: Faithless electors, they are called apparently.... This US system is just a maze of kwaruption

11/13/20, 15:34 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): See as the Catholic church in America deny the poor man because he's a democrat 🤣. This life is a pot of beans
11/13/20, 15:34 - Kenneth Maths. US.: This ur exclamation sef is scary😁🤣
11/13/20, 15:35 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Small thing, them no go give an communion again 😂
11/13/20, 15:36 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Na 9ja dem fit do that kain thing.....the spirituality for 9ja pass our own😁
11/13/20, 15:36 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): It's a funny something na. The church aligns with Trump because of abortion and gay rights. Them come abandon practicing Catholic as per black sheep
11/13/20, 15:59 - +234 802 474 1100: As in.... A lot of people dont realize it when you look at the Church's stance..

His bishop threatened to deprive him of communion during yhe Obama days if i remember correctly
11/13/20, 16:07 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): The pope has given Biden his blessings and congratulations sha so, make him bishop go hug transformer
11/13/20, 16:12 - +234 802 474 1100: You  know say your Pope na closet-globalist/liberal
11/13/20, 16:12 - +234 802 474 1100: the amercian bishops are always up in arms against him
11/13/20, 16:13 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Closet ke? Ma. Speaks him mind well well
11/13/20, 16:14 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Them no plenty reach abeg. Let them be acting like heavenly gatekeepers. Na for gate them go dey miss the enjoyment inside heaven
11/13/20, 16:14 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: If not for God, e remain small, all of them together catholic Protestant Buddhist and Sanyo I for no just do anyone again, the confusion is too much
11/13/20, 16:16 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Las las e go de attend Mass for vatican🤣
11/13/20, 16:16 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Jesus sef na Judaism e leave for us, na discrimination make them call us Christians, today e don plenty, I don tire
11/13/20, 16:17 - Kenneth Maths. US.: I was still asking myself this question days ago.....why do i even practice any religion🙈
11/13/20, 16:17 - Dee: I just want to ask. Between Biden and Trump, which one of them acts more like a Christian?
11/13/20, 16:18 - Kenneth Maths. US.: 1st of all, who is a Christian?
11/13/20, 16:18 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Ayam liking these points and questions
11/13/20, 16:19 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): That's why some today say they are spiritual but to not identify with any religion
11/13/20, 16:20 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: The voters🤣🤣🤣
11/13/20, 16:20 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Their discrimination and condemnation complete gaan🤣
11/13/20, 16:21 - Dee: To make it very simple, (whether or not it is actually true) which one of them  "looks" like he obeys the 10 commandments? Which one of them would we want to introduce as our "Christian" friend.
11/13/20, 16:21 - +234 802 474 1100: Yeah... The "pharisees" of our time dont make it any easier actually. Dem just sabi how to create "rules and regulations"
11/13/20, 16:22 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Trump is a Christian “of” the world. Biden is a Christian “in” the world🤣
11/13/20, 16:22 - Dee: 😀 ha tor.
11/13/20, 16:23 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): "Praise be!" 😅
11/13/20, 16:26 - Dee: I ask this because the entire judge of someone's Christianity has somehow  come down to where you stand regarding abortion. Even if you lie, cheat, commit adultery, covet, etc just be against abortion and you are automatically a good Christian. 

But you could be honest, faithful, friendly, humble, loving, generous, etc, but support abortion, and you automatically become demon spawn.
11/13/20, 16:26 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Lerrus nor be political. Biden is a family man and has had only one wife. Trump is on number 3. Biden 1-0 Trump (per 10 commandments. Let's not even talk about grabbing pussy and Epstein his friend)
11/13/20, 16:27 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Lemme rearrange the commandments fess😁

1. Thou shall not commit adultery
Trump: *Guilty*
Biden: *No evidence yet*

2. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor 
Trump: *Guilty*
Biden: Not known or openly disclosed at this time

3. You shall not commit murder
Trump: Ignored COVID and many have died under his watch so *GUILTY*
Biden: People died during ebola although they claim they were transparent and fought it. *Cannot confirm guilty/not guilty charge*
11/13/20, 16:28 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Trump historically has cheated the lowest of the low in society through all his dealing, right down to suing people for their last penny. That's in violation of commandments 6 and 10 right there so...
11/13/20, 16:29 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Ah, he is the champion of false witness oh. Shebi he took out full page ads asking for death penalty for the central park 5. Even now that they are exonerated, he refuse to admit he was wrong
11/13/20, 16:29 - Dee: Ok so if we know this, what justification do people have for thinking Trump is the savior sent by God? Because he belongs to a party that traditionally is against abortion? Whether or not he believes it himself? Because I have a hard time believing the same Trump, will have any issues with  abortion
11/13/20, 16:30 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Wait first your list is too long. See am here;
You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all ur mind and all your strength
Trump: capital ODO!
Biden: well I no Dey him chest

2. You must love your Neighbour as ur self
Trump: anoda capital ODO!
Biden: 1

So I guess Biden wins😁😁😁
11/13/20, 16:30 - Kenneth Maths. US.: 4. You shall not have other gods before me
Trump: He claims to be the chosen one (Jesus) *Guilty*
Biden: No evidence as of today
11/13/20, 16:30 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Last last sha, na God know. Because according to Catholic teaching, if Trump sincerely repents of his sins before he dies, na heaven bound
11/13/20, 16:30 - Kenneth Maths. US.: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
11/13/20, 16:31 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): 🤣🤣🤣
11/13/20, 16:31 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Not to mention not paying tax, even Jesus say make u give Caesar him property.
11/13/20, 16:31 - Kenneth Maths. US.: You are too wise
11/13/20, 16:32 - Kenneth Maths. US.: This right here sha.....God is too merciful sha
11/13/20, 16:32 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: If I see am for heaven sha...well...let’s just say me and the vine workers wey enter farm for 9am go dey d same side dey look the ones wey show by 5pm
11/13/20, 16:32 - +234 802 474 1100: On behalf of people who like to draw attention to irrelevant things... Biden has had two wives actually,
11/13/20, 16:32 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Taink you my brother! This is the very paradox people refuse to resolve in their minds. Why? I'm not exactly sure
11/13/20, 16:33 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Aha😁
11/13/20, 16:33 - Kenneth Maths. US.: One had a crash and died o
11/13/20, 16:33 - Kenneth Maths. US.: The Church allows u to remarry bro
11/13/20, 16:33 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: The first one died, bond broken!
11/13/20, 16:34 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Say it louder into his ears since u r closer abeg
11/13/20, 16:34 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Lol
11/13/20, 16:34 - Dee: By all these comments, at best, it is very clear we think Trump is not the kind of Christian we would want to be associated with. Rightly so too. 

So once again, why do some  Christians believe him to be our savior from God?
11/13/20, 16:34 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Taink you for acknowledging the "irrelevant" part. I will acknowledge I didn't know he had two wives. I do know his first wife died though, when his kinds were young
11/13/20, 16:34 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Na only for Naija dem go dey look you like say na you kill am if u marry again
11/13/20, 16:34 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): 🤣

11/13/20, 16:39 - Kenneth Maths. US.: No motivate am too much o, cos na to de carry belle every year be that🤣
11/13/20, 16:39 - Dee: I have really tried to understand their point of view regarding Trump. But I keep coming back to same conclusion. "It doesn't make sense "
11/13/20, 16:40 - Dee: 😀
11/13/20, 16:40 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: For that one I don give am permission to marry more wives
11/13/20, 16:42 - Kenneth Maths. US.: On the top of their list of spirituality/Christianity is Prolife and abortion and seeing that first, closes their eyes and senses to every other thing below.

That is why it is good to put ur best points first anytime
11/13/20, 16:42 - +234 802 474 1100: Lemme copy and archive this statement...
11/13/20, 16:43 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: I fit help u print and frame sef

11/13/20, 16:45 - +234 802 474 1100: A very manic need to make sure the laws are pro-life, while disrespecting your neighbour who is alive(life) in front of you... Idontgerrit walahi
11/13/20, 16:46 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): What is pro-life? I have not seen anybody define this thing properly oh. Because anti-abortion is pro-birth, one of many issues that constitute what 'pro-life' should mean
11/13/20, 16:46 - +234 802 474 1100: y'av loss me biko.. explain again...
11/13/20, 16:46 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Homeless people dying on the street is not pro-life
11/13/20, 16:47 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Euthanasia is not pro-life
11/13/20, 16:47 - Kenneth Maths. US.: From thw way they think:
Fighting for the one who can not fight for his/her lyf in the womb
11/13/20, 16:47 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Fighting against investment in healthcare for drug addicts is not pro-life
11/13/20, 16:47 - Kenneth Maths. US.: The*
11/13/20, 16:47 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): High cost of medicare, damning low income people to low quality of life is not pro-life
11/13/20, 16:48 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Need I go on?
11/13/20, 16:48 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Increasing tax for the wealthy and cutting short the life of their profit is not pro-life!!! Amen republi...sorry wrong group
11/13/20, 16:48 - Dee: I get that. But America,  even though majorly christian, is not ruled by laws of Christianity but by the constitution. There are also lots of Atheist, Muslims, etc in America. 

The constitution allows "All Americans" a wide range of freedoms. 

Because u don't like it doesn't mean someone else, that doesn't share your beliefs, shouldn't be able to get it. 

And because something is allowed, doesn't force you to do it. So if you don't to, stay away.
11/13/20, 16:49 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): 600 years of enjoyment for you please 🙌🏼
11/13/20, 16:49 - Dee: Perfectly worded.
11/13/20, 16:52 - Dee: I particularly like this one.
11/13/20, 16:52 - +234 802 474 1100: The one that trips me the most ehn... Is that the support for gun rights and the 2nd amendment is very strongly correlated with "Christians" in America.....
11/13/20, 16:52 - +234 802 474 1100: That one just offs me....
11/13/20, 16:53 - Dee: Ha,  the power of the NRA.
11/13/20, 16:53 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): That's another one. Like, if you are fighting to have a gun to defend yourself with, how are you not plotting to kill someone eventually?
11/13/20, 16:54 - +234 802 474 1100: God, Guns and Country was the title of an article i once read
11/13/20, 16:54 - +234 802 971 7134: Organized religion na scam
11/13/20, 16:54 - Dee: I think, somewhere along the line, we stopped practicing religion with sense. Maybe we never did.
11/13/20, 16:55 - +234 802 971 7134: We never did o
11/13/20, 16:56 - +234 802 474 1100: 🤣
11/13/20, 17:00 - Benedict: The default setting of a religious mind is senselessness. It takes a lot of effort to be religious and have sense. And oftentimes that sense comes with the loss of religion.
11/13/20, 17:01 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): I agree. Sense was not necessary in the beginning. Just obedience
11/13/20, 17:12 - Kenneth Maths. US.: You guys wee not kill me with lafta......abeg i de drive o

*NFCS UI ALUMNI CHARITY VISITATION*

Its Lenten Season again and the Church encourages us to Pray, Fast, and practice ALMSGIVING

This year, we will be visiting the University College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan, where we hope to, by God’s grace and your charitable donations, support some patients struggling financially to continue their care. We have carried out a reconnaissance visit and chosen 10 cases from Pediatrics (being priority) and other departments. A total of #651,800 is needed to put smiles on the face of these families for Easter.

All payments should be made into the NFCS UI Alumni account with “Charity Visit” narration.

Nigeria Federation of Catholic Students, University of Ibadan Alumni
Fidelity Bank
6060294851

We also solicit for material donations (clothes, beverage, toiletries, food items) which we will be supporting the patients and the ALANU FUND with.

God bless us all during this period of Lent as we donate generously to achieve this sacred obligation.

NFCS Alumni... Still living the faith 😇

3/7/21, 16:07 - +234 803 075 0650: Me I need a 1st o😭
3/9/21, 21:05 - +234 803 075 0650: Abeg, I have an idea I want to discuss. It concerns the NFCS alumni but I want to bounce it off the juggernauts here so that if I'm wrong, it could be shut down before I misyearn
3/9/21, 21:06 - +234 802 474 1100: Abeg bounce
3/9/21, 21:07 - +234 803 075 0650: It's about the monthly dues. The last financial report I heard reads like people aren't paying. It's failed completely. And I think I know why
3/9/21, 21:09 - +234 803 075 0650: 12k a year might look small, but it's actually too much if we consider that most alumni belong to so many other groups like the NFCS alumni and would have to make financial contributions too.
I, if I'm to use myself as example, belong to over 15 of such groups and make financial contributions to almost all
3/9/21, 21:11 - +234 803 075 0650: What I realise is that the dues must be small enough that someone can just pay it off once. If it isn't,  other financial commitments will come in the way and people will naturally default
3/9/21, 21:12 - +234 803 075 0650: For e.g, St Cecilia alumni's annual dues is just 3k - and boy, they're succeeding in wrenching that money from most alumni. Their account is very healthy
3/9/21, 21:13 - +234 803 075 0650: Why must we have ours at 12k and yet only a handful of people pay? Why not crash it and then go on massive campaign to collect from as much people as is possible?
3/9/21, 21:13 - +234 803 075 0650: Over to you!!!!
3/9/21, 21:15 - +234 802 474 1100: The logic makes sense. To be honest, the Exco’s have tried other means to improve participation. Not much succèss.
Definitely an option that could be explored. Smart can help take it to them I think
3/9/21, 21:18 - +234 803 075 0650: If it's accepted, the guys here can start by paying up for last year and this year and we'll have people whose function will be that of a taxman, gently urging members to pay, but harassing others like Eugene and Omo to pay up. I want to believe in a month, the association's finance will be transformed
3/9/21, 21:18 - +234 803 072 5702: You’re on point Chris. It’s actually been discussed at one of the meetings and it was reduced to N500 monthly or N6,000 annual
3/9/21, 21:20 - +234 803 075 0650: They need to reduce it further by half and give me the function of harassing old members. I assure you within a month, close to 50 people will pay up
3/9/21, 21:20 - +234 803 072 5702: This na d crux of the matter...the Fin Sec/Treasurer that are supposed to harass people constantly to pay always seem to forget...until at a general meeting
3/9/21, 21:21 - +234 803 072 5702: Nothing is heard about dues until meeting day most times...and everything goes quiet till the next meeting
3/9/21, 21:23 - +234 803 075 0650: I dont see why st Cecilia can get most of its members to pay up their dues every single year and NFCS is failing. We have to take this seriously,  beyond the excos
3/9/21, 21:24 - +234 803 072 5702: Well...the experiment showed that it was still the same people who were paying when it was 12k that are paying now that it’s 6k. 
The prodding of people to pay is failing woefully and should be tackled
3/9/21, 21:24 - +234 802 474 1100: You know St Cecilia is a cult na!! 🏃🏾🏃🏾🏃🏾🏃🏾🏃🏾
3/9/21, 21:24 - +234 803 075 0650: We can create a cult here too
3/9/21, 21:26 - +234 803 075 0650: Honestly I'm serious. @2347033020215, abeg speak up. The financial position of the association is embarrassing
3/9/21, 21:26 - +234 803 072 5702: Very very.
3/9/21, 21:39 - +234 803 072 5702: @2348030750650 can we schedule a time to discuss it with some of the excos?...probably after the charity visitation exercise
3/9/21, 21:40 - +234 803 075 0650: Sure
3/9/21, 21:42 - +234 803 072 5702: ...speaking of which...sincere appreciation to the all who have donated from here...the acct don dey rise like garri...but still some distance away from the target. 
Abeg I’m still appealing for your support o...nothing is too small

3/9/21, 22:04 - Ini Eket: Lol @speak up
3/9/21, 22:05 - Ini Eket: Good point though
3/10/21, 00:16 - Kenneth Maths. US.: @2348030750650 while I agree with your point(s) and also believe that things could be tough on people, we could look at it from another angle...

1. Is it the case that people are not paying bcos 6k is too much or like @2348030725702 said, there is no follow up (as such) on the part of those collecting the dues?

2. While I understand that St. Cecilia is a cult according to @2348024741100 (😁) and they pay 3k easily (probably because it is small), have we thought about asking people 1 on 1 why they are not paying rather than asking them to pay during meetings (mostly) and a week/day to the meeting on telegram?Understanding why might help better than bringing the dues down. 
On a personal note, I have not paid in ages🙈 not because I don't have the money but I usually don't act immediately and I end up forgetting. At times, the wife sends me to the store and she needs to send a text after telling me the 5 (only o) things to buy b4 leaving home.
3/10/21, 01:31 - +234 802 474 1100: All the reasons join to be honest. I praise Smart for instance for still be really connected to everything that’s going on. To be honest, on my own part I’ve zoned out. I won’t confess that out there but I’ve moved on. I will attend when I can, contribute when I remember or am reminded but it’s honestly not up there top of mind. And this is coming from someone who was an Exco so you can imagine how others feel. 

I can imagine that it’s the same for quite a number of others. Or heck maybe it’s just me 👀
3/10/21, 01:37 - +234 802 474 1100: So the work to be done in my own mind is a lot. The unifying reason to make the alumni strong was/is the community that we could create. Something like the “cult” at st Cecilia. If that is not recreated, the only appeal you have to alumni is to come together to donate to NFCS(most people would pass), charity visitations( most of us do this anyways in other groups), get togethers(life has made it difficult to meet a lot of the friends you really want to meet e.g Kenneth so that he can give me dollars) —- so what exactly is the value proposition for the alumni to the US the alumni
3/10/21, 01:38 - +234 802 474 1100: There’s still a chance to make this dream possible  for recent sets

3/10/21, 14:15 - +234 802 971 7134: My own reasons are these and some others people like Kenneth and I have discussed about
3/10/21, 14:18 - +234 802 971 7134: Misplaced priorities is the umbrella I’d put everything else under. It doesn’t cover it all but that’s the best way I can classify it
3/10/21, 14:30 - Bootylicious Honeypie: We are legion!
3/10/21, 14:33 - Kenneth Maths. US.: @2347033020215 & @2348127379568 (although Eugene has spoken) are you also part of the legion? That way we know how and where to start to tackle this problem from (if it can be tackled)
3/10/21, 15:25 - +234 803 075 0650: And the people here are largely the core of the alumni o. You can then imagine what others are thinking!
3/10/21, 17:16 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Me I’m the bucket gaan gaan, I lost interest when we couldn’t discuss a what next plan to a logical conclusion. After contribution for existing body and charity visit, there was nothing next. Then I completely closed mind after the Prof. Ben issue, I was like I can’t be wasting headache on what is not affecting my 3BL
3/10/21, 17:22 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Lol! Akor I’ve. It paid Cclian dues o, but the reason is funny. It’s because they used to announce it on the grp 🤣🤣🤣🤣 N3k was just recvd from Chris Akor being payment of dues for year 2021, plix some of us don’t like seeing our name outside🤣
3/10/21, 17:23 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: *ive not paid
3/10/21, 17:33 - +234 803 075 0650: You could request to be anonymous na
3/10/21, 17:33 - +234 803 075 0650: Like some people do
3/10/21, 17:38 - Ini Eket: I guess d zoning out partially applies to me too, esp since d move to Telegram, dnt knw why am more active on WhatsApp groups. I know I am owing also.
I think I zone in more with this group 😁😁
3/10/21, 17:42 - Kenneth Maths. US.: *#lobatan*
When all the "godfathers" who are known to have "barged in" in 2006 (if you don't know the story ask @2348028945332 🤣) have zoned out, water don pass garri be that!

@2348030750650 what say you now?
3/10/21, 17:45 - +234 803 075 0650: The thing tire me o🙆🏼‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️🙆🏼‍♂️
3/10/21, 17:46 - +234 803 075 0650: What I can only say is, even if we've zoned out, we owe it to ourselves and our legacy to at least support the group financially
3/10/21, 17:48 - +234 803 075 0650: Sorry o. I seem to have a lot of time in my hands right now to chat. That's what you get when you're unemployed,  stay-at-home dad!🙈🙈🙈🙈
3/10/21, 17:52 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Bro, that telegram na im spoil things finally. The beginning of the spoiling (for St. Cecilia in particular) was that I could not connect with the gist any more. Best thing was to conserve my reading energy. Now telegram is on my work phone so 🤣 weekend shut down!
3/10/21, 17:53 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Interestingly, na me been dey make this argument that year for NFCS oh. Say at all at all na im bad pass. Take a look at me now...
3/10/21, 18:37 - +234 803 072 5702: Interesting takes. Zoning out is completely normal as person dey progress for life and other things take priority...Alumni associations, by their very nature are meant to be set-based...most thriving Alumni associations are...
3/10/21, 18:39 - +234 803 072 5702: ...cos the moment you can’t personally relate with what is going on...interest levels naturally drop. No two ways about am
3/10/21, 18:41 - +234 803 072 5702: Before I continue, @2348127379568 and @447788152190 abeg gift the body the tonic Sola for the anthem...the anthem sef dey zone out small small from meetings😁...needs to be revived and re-learnt
3/10/21, 18:52 - +234 803 072 5702: Very apt. With families and other priorities, “being active” at this level is to support financially, pop-in to one or two meetings (virtual makes this easier) and render advice when convenient.
3/10/21, 19:00 - +234 803 072 5702: The telegram issue ehn...sometimes, three days, I never open am...the app is not gaining acceptance as general usage as expected. When person finally check, na newspaper headlines and news wey we don read tire dey dey dere...
But I think the move to Telegram was inevitable though...the Whatsapp group was full and more people wanted to join (not as if most of them have said a word sef, talkless of being involved😏)
3/10/21, 19:01 - +234 803 075 0650: That telegram na real struggle o
3/10/21, 19:19 - Kenneth Maths. US.: I was even thinking with the move to telegram,  we would have at least 700 members🙈 my expectation too high😁
3/10/21, 22:03 - +234 802 474 1100: Telegram sef join. And I was one of the advocates too. To be honest it was the only choice as Smart said too...

We just need to acknowledge that the challenge runs deeper than just the amount of dues. As someone already noticed too, most of the thriving alumni groups use a “set” model to help keep graduating sets together... whatever the activities they decide to do.... the set champion or leader can then work to raise the dues/contribution among his constituents. That way you at least also have events/activities that best suited to the set and their schedules.

For dues e.g you could say sets greater than 10yrs will pay 20k for example annually... they can sort the contribution among themselves..... then 5-10yrs 10k for example as well... 

If there are 15sets represented for example total dues could come to say 400k annually..... and sets of course can go above their minimum....

Woo... I no even know again. But something radical has got to give. #restructuring
3/13/21, 01:47 - Kenneth Maths. US.: @2348030750650 I have not forgotten this, less stress at work now and more time for me to search for the original message from out founding fathers😁

3/13/21, 01:50 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Kkz, some brain wave idea guys dat came up wen I was discussing with Madam Omo and it appeared there was an opportunity for our two family vacations to clash which wud add to d fun of vacation...
I remember d idea of group vacations have been muted in d past also...
Also, we have had several near 'misses' of different people having vacation around d same locations outside d country n jst missing themselves due to timing....
So....
The idea dat if we have friends with common interest of having vacations once in a while, local or international, wud be gr8 if we cud plan ahead towards same time... Of course while considering dt some people esp as we have several youthful couples wud be holidaying for special Missions outside holidaying for vacation

4/17/21, 21:36 - +234 802 474 1100: The only wahala with this vaccination na the  the other half of the population wey no wan take am...

Covid go just Dey wait make immunity wane for the other side then rebound
4/17/21, 21:36 - +234 802 474 1100: Vaccination success depends on public acceptance else protection Is short lived
4/17/21, 21:37 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Please tell @2347033020215 o
4/17/21, 21:37 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Doing survey upadan🙄
4/17/21, 21:37 - +234 802 474 1100: 😂😂
4/17/21, 21:37 - +234 802 474 1100: At this rate, Covid is here to stay
4/17/21, 21:38 - Ini Eket: 😁🤣
4/17/21, 21:38 - Kenneth Maths. US.: If so, in some selfish way, it is fine as long as we nor catch am🙈
4/17/21, 21:38 - +234 803 075 0650: There are two ways to get rid of Covid-19. The China way or by vaccinating 80% of the population
4/17/21, 21:39 - +234 802 474 1100: Unfortunately.... everyone is certain to catch it at some point if it’s here to stay
4/17/21, 21:39 - Ini Eket: its already settled in... we have been leaving with it since, we probably may have caught it and not even known
4/17/21, 21:40 - Ini Eket: cos all that social distancing thing did not work at all,
4/17/21, 21:40 - +234 802 474 1100: That one na fake theory 😀
4/17/21, 21:40 - +234 803 075 0650: Lagos, for instance,  is nearing herd immunity. 1 in 4 Lagosians tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies
4/17/21, 21:40 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Well, I am sure I must have had it at some point cos this our Florida pipu nor bliv in COVID like that
4/17/21, 21:41 - +234 802 474 1100: Which research you Dey quote abeg
4/17/21, 21:41 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Exactly
4/17/21, 21:41 - Kenneth Maths. US.: 🤣🤣
4/17/21, 21:41 - +234 802 474 1100: All this exactly, scientists 😀😀 which research
4/17/21, 21:41 - +234 803 075 0650: I'll look for it and post it
4/17/21, 21:42 - +234 802 474 1100: You just wan embrace the information wey you like 😂😀
4/17/21, 21:42 - Ini Eket: Not fake ooo, our luck as Nigerians is that most of us probably have inbuilt vaccination or defenses
4/17/21, 21:42 - Kenneth Maths. US.: AbanzIwez Research
4/17/21, 21:42 - Kenneth Maths. US.: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
4/17/21, 21:42 - +234 802 474 1100: Wey you post it... Kenneth you go run the math on the adequate sample size to make that conclusion for a population of 200m people 😂😂

4/17/21, 21:48 - Kenneth Maths. US.: 1 to 5
1 to 10
4/17/21, 21:51 - +234 803 075 0650: That was the first wave o. Many people were infected during the second wave
4/17/21, 21:55 - Ini Eket: Yupz
4/17/21, 21:55 - Kenneth Maths. US.: @2348024741100 the number of states used for the research is statistically insignificant to make any conclusion based on the number of states and the geography ("spread") where the samples were drawn from
4/17/21, 21:55 - +234 803 075 0650: https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/23/nigeria-survey-suggests-23-of-lagos-residents-had-covid-last-year
The figure for Lagos is 23%
4/17/21, 21:56 - +234 803 075 0650: I'm talking about Lagos only
4/17/21, 21:59 - +234 802 474 1100: Okay o...
But don’t be too quick to quote that data o..
6-8months after infection unfortunately people are losing their immunity
4/17/21, 21:59 - +234 802 474 1100: So it’s back to square 1
4/17/21, 22:00 - +234 802 474 1100: Which is the point I’m making with mass vaccination —- it doesn’t work if the vaccination is spread over a period longer that the immunity it gives... it would arguably be never ending..

Or even become an annual vaccination
4/17/21, 22:01 - +234 802 474 1100: So @2347033020215 gaan take vaccine 😀
4/17/21, 22:02 - +234 803 075 0650: Pfizer's CEO is even talking of a booster shot in a year's time
4/17/21, 22:02 - +234 802 474 1100: Those ones have hammered... It’s time to buy some Pfizer shares 😀😀
4/17/21, 22:03 - +234 802 474 1100: Steady revenue stream for years to come

4/17/21, 22:04 - +234 803 075 0650: Roche no attempt the vaccine abi it failed like Merks and Sanofils'?
4/17/21, 22:04 - +234 802 474 1100: Meanwhile ... see una pastor @14692437489
4/17/21, 22:05 - +234 802 474 1100: Nah... Roche was never a vaccine maker
4/17/21, 22:05 - +234 802 474 1100: The vaccine makers showed their history and legacy... Pfizer
Nah GSK fall hand
4/17/21, 22:06 - +234 802 474 1100: But the PCR tests are commonly don on Roche diagnostics
4/17/21, 22:07 - +234 803 075 0650: Yeah. Vaccine production was never a profitable business. Pfizer, GSK and the rest wanted to stop vaccine production. It was Bill Gates that stepped in to salvage the situation with GAVI
4/17/21, 22:11 - +234 802 474 1100: Not sure i agrée... the vaccines they had were reaching end of their product lifecycle... patents were expired, competition from generics and the new vaccines like the malaria vaccine were not giving the expected results... that’s why they wanted to pull out... not necessarily because the whole vaccine business was not profitably....

As you can see from Covid vaccines, in this phase where innovation is a differnetiator they are relishing their time.... so much so that they refused to drop their patent claims for generics manufacturers to produce for the rest of the world since they can’t produce enough themselves...

Long story phew
4/17/21, 22:13 - +234 803 075 0650: OK. Make I no go dey argue with expert. I'm sorry🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
4/17/21, 22:13 - Ini Eket: So if everyone dosnt take at d same time, those that have taken will have to take all over again later?
4/17/21, 22:15 - +234 802 474 1100: That would be my personal projection... I await further analysis from experts...

But I don’t see a way for the world out of this with the way vaccinations are going
4/17/21, 22:17 - Ini Eket: If that's d case, then it should be made compulsory
4/17/21, 22:18 - +234 802 474 1100: We were only declared a polio free nation two years ago... because we couldn’t properly vaccinate our population to eradicate polio...

And that’s polio, less infectious, and long protection after vaccination... 
imagine the case with Covid where reinfections are possible
4/17/21, 22:19 - +234 802 474 1100: Again, just my thoughts... I haven’t exactly tested this thinking 🤔 elsewhere 😀
4/17/21, 23:39 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Was just going to say politics and vaccines/medicine are not really the same 🤣
4/17/21, 23:43 - +234 803 075 0650: No mind me. Na too much reading of news about the vaccine and so forth. I no go repeat am again🙈🙈🙈

5/30/21, 18:16 - +234 802 474 1100: Ini though... are you asking about their general investment platforms or are you comparing agriculture investment options?
5/30/21, 18:17 - Ini Eket: Just info, so I was very active with farmcrowdy for several years and they did very fine. Now they have become crowdyvest and changed their management. No issues with that, but feel like migrating to piggyvest and trying to get a feel of how they are as well.
5/30/21, 18:19 - +234 802 474 1100: Ok so you still want to do farm and agric investments.... like the former farmcrowdy
that one I’m not a fan of, I no sabi am

Piggy est and TGIC and the new crowdyvest pool monies and help you invest in different categories. It’s great for when you don’t want the stress of constantly monitoring market prices
5/30/21, 18:40 - Ini Eket: Kkz 👍
5/30/21, 18:47 - Kenneth Maths. US.: All this scam of a thing this pipu are doing upadan
5/30/21, 18:49 - Kenneth Maths. US.: @2347033020215 do you know that those guys i asked about from u that day have bn owing for over 6months now past the agreed tume of payment
5/30/21, 18:52 - +234 803 075 0650: When someone guarantees you a certain return from agriculture,  that is itself a highly risky activity whose final produce can be impacted by many uncontrollable factors, you should be prepared for this outcome.
5/30/21, 18:53 - Kenneth Maths. US.: I know..... i nor do again....I am fine with the volatility and risk in crypto and stock
5/30/21, 18:56 - +234 803 075 0650: Even for the most genuine of them, with current realities of climate change and the security situation in Nigeria,  you can't even account for rain, security of the farm site etc.
5/30/21, 19:01 - +234 802 474 1100: I generally don’t do investments that are too good to be true 😀.

5/30/21, 19:20 - Kenneth Maths. US.: I see the email those they are owing are sending every day
5/30/21, 19:23 - Kenneth Maths. US.: I have made good money from it, from not been too greedy
5/30/21, 19:25 - +234 803 075 0650: No try am o. People are actually been pushed into forex to make money for the expert traders. Over 97% of forex traders lose money big time to the few experts who lure people in to make the size of their profits bigger
5/30/21, 19:27 - Kenneth Maths. US.: .....and the stock i do is mosty from my company while the bulk investment is in crypto 🙈
5/30/21, 19:28 - +234 803 075 0650: See how Elon Musk take una go cruise come back🤪
5/30/21, 19:28 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Though with the current situation i don slow fwn
5/30/21, 19:29 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Well, i have made money, Americans are just foolish especially with "big" names
5/30/21, 19:29 - Kenneth Maths. US.: dwn*
5/30/21, 19:30 - +234 803 075 0650: Not exactly. That's always how the big guys make money. You can never have the kind of information they have. Besides, they can collude to crash the market, but the stuff very cheaply and deliberately drive the price at high again to cash out. They're masters of the game.
5/30/21, 19:33 - Kenneth Maths. US.: The very reason why i say they are foolish and follow the big names......
U need to hear of introductions at the beginning of a semester in a gradute class here and when the professor ask who their role model is, u hear Bill Gates, Elon Musk almost all round the class
5/30/21, 19:34 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Make i go make small money jare, i de come
5/30/21, 19:39 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Try buying ETFs...
5/30/21, 20:10 - +234 802 474 1100: Yup. Another good option. Steady growth with the market
5/30/21, 20:10 - +234 802 474 1100: @2347033020215 do you bank with Stan chart? If you do, they’ve got a few options to invest in some global hedge funds
5/30/21, 20:11 - Ini Eket: No, does Stanbic offer similar?
5/30/21, 20:11 - +234 802 474 1100: Growth funds and income funds(with monthly dividends if you want that)
5/30/21, 20:11 - +234 802 474 1100: Stanbic does. But they invest through Stan chart I gather...
5/30/21, 20:11 - +234 802 474 1100: So better go to source
5/30/21, 20:12 - Ini Eket: Hmm, kkz
5/30/21, 20:12 - +234 802 474 1100: And the investments are in dollars so you are also protected from inflation
5/30/21, 20:13 - +234 803 075 0650: Hedge funds investments are the most promising and secure for now
5/30/21, 20:13 - +234 803 075 0650: Hedge funds rule America - and they're almost always profitable and relatively low risk
5/30/21, 21:32 - +234 803 072 5702: PiggyVest is basically for savings o. It’s best for daily, weekly, monthly savings kind of thing…like savings kolo. There’s interest but except you are saving in millions, na very small. 8% annual or something like that as at last I checked.
5/30/21, 21:34 - +234 803 075 0650: And savings in Naira is a direct loss of money. Inflation is at 18 or 19%. Any savings that doesn't guarantee you that is a loss of money
5/30/21, 21:35 - +234 803 075 0650: Truth is, you can't save in Naira currently in Nigeria. The best way is to convert to dollars and save even under your bed
5/30/21, 21:35 - +234 803 072 5702: Exactly.
5/30/21, 21:37 - +234 802 474 1100: Unfortunately you first need to take the hit on the dollar naira rate 😀 at almost 500
5/30/21, 21:37 - +234 802 474 1100: Chai... Bubu
5/30/21, 21:38 - +234 803 075 0650: We said this when it was 360 to $1
5/30/21, 21:39 - +234 802 474 1100: True sha...
Most of these experts still predict a correction to 430 ish
5/30/21, 21:39 - +234 802 474 1100: That’s my only concern for this expensive dollars at 500
5/30/21, 21:40 - +234 803 075 0650: Between 2015 and now the CBN has printed over N10 trillion for the federal government and they'll continue to print because the government will continue to pay salaries and make expenditure. What does this tell us? The naira will continue to tumble in value
5/30/21, 21:40 - +234 802 474 1100: Even election dollars fit correct am o
When politicians scatter ground with dollars campaign
5/30/21, 21:41 - +234 802 474 1100: Chris... this statement in isolation does nt tell the story...

You know how much dollars US fed don print to bailout their economy?
5/30/21, 21:42 - +234 803 075 0650: Yes. I know. Their economy can sustain it. There's productivity. What is more, inflation was below 2%. What about Nigeria?
5/30/21, 21:42 - Dee: Since we are not inventing / producing much  to export, it stands to reason that it will get worse than the 500 it is at the moment. 

So you don't get in the same situation when it gets to 700, buy bulk now and put in all the places that can increase it for you over time. 50% low risk. 30% medium risk. 20% high risk. Sth like that
5/30/21, 21:43 - +234 802 474 1100: Or all the other CBNs for that matter... money supply no be the issue for this matter...
It’s a specific fear that our country is on the brink that is driving people heading to other currencies at the nairas expense
5/30/21, 21:43 - +234 802 474 1100: Self fulfilling prophecy 😂😂
5/30/21, 21:45 - +234 803 075 0650: @2348024741100 money supply is a problem. Zimbabwe and Venezuela are examples
5/30/21, 21:46 - +234 802 474 1100: Make we no argue sha... But like I talk na just the trust in the dollar Dey hold that currency... the amount wey the US govt don print no be here😀
5/30/21, 21:48 - +234 803 075 0650: In the early 1990s,Zimbabwe dollar was equivalent to the US dollar. Mugabe just woke up one day and ordered the central bank to print money to pay off all Zimbabwe's foreign debts. That was the point the slide began and at the time the Zimbabwean dollar was abolished, you need over 10 billion of it - carried in wheelbarrow- to buy a single loaf of bread
5/30/21, 21:48 - +234 802 474 1100: The other investment option is to invest in micro finance banks... they are usually searching for cash flow for their loans...

They typically offer a rerun of 3-5% monthly on deposits
5/30/21, 21:48 - +234 802 474 1100: Medium risk
5/30/21, 21:48 - +234 803 075 0650: What has been helping Nigeria is that as they're printing money,  they're simultaneously crowding out the private sector
5/30/21, 21:48 - +234 802 474 1100: In Naira
5/30/21, 21:51 - +234 802 474 1100: Yeah ... I think this is the extreme example sha...

Our Naira will not behave like that In the name of .....😀 Amen.
5/30/21, 21:59 - Ini Eket: Chai, thought I was seeing up to 15%
5/30/21, 22:05 - Dee: Lol. On one hand, yes it is true. We study the past, we watch trends, we predict the future to be grim, we buy dollars in bulk to invest elsewhere, demand rises, naira falls, confirming our theory. Leading to more dollars being bought. 

But what is the alternative? Say We do not buy dollars to invest. People will still travel out for Schooling.  Recreation. Relocation. Child birth. Importation of foreign goods ( TVs, Cars, Aircrafts, laptops, phones, etc)  cos we do not produce them here. Even my current toothpick box says "made in china" on it. We import a lot of things. Coupled with all those personal reasons mentioned above, there will always be a demand for dollars. 

So whether  you buy dollars to invest or not, as long as we continue to import everything,  in the long run, naira will continue to weaken against the dollars. And the value of your money disappears gradually. 

Really can't escape it
5/30/21, 22:09 - +234 802 474 1100: I dig this really. And it’s true.

However it was also true through Jonathan’s 6years and Obasanjos 8yrs with a relatively stable forex rate. What’s different?

Jonathan’s govt (and Obasanjo) generated relatively more trust and attracted even diaspora Nigerians to return! And with it their investment and money.

The belief part is such a powerful thing. The lack of belief is accelerating the decline that would have been a manageable annual 6-10% inflation rate
5/30/21, 22:11 - +234 802 474 1100: Everyone now makes money here. Exports it out in anticipation of a japa 😀😀😃😂
5/30/21, 22:14 - Dee: 😀😀 the exodus is alarming.
5/30/21, 22:32 - Kenneth Maths. US.: @2348024741100 & @2348030750650 when u guys are done with this and there is a consensus on what is right and best let us talk.
Thank you😁
5/30/21, 22:38 - +234 803 075 0650: Oga, commot here. You that is benefitting from our misfortune. If you send $100 to Niaja now, they'll value it more than they did in 2014. You're an everlasting big man now in Niaja if you don't know 🤪

6/3/21, 10:48 - +234 803 075 0650: Ibori loot foundation: A fitting way to remember a criminal in perpetuity
Christopher Akor
When news broke last week that the Accountant General of the federation told members of the National Assembly that the £4.2 million returned Ibori loot has been paid to the Delta state government, news hungry journalists ran with that obvious lie. Anyone who knows anything about the agreement signed between the Nigerian and UK government knows it is not possible to return the money to Delta state government because what the money will be used for has been agreed upon between the UK- which technically owns the money, being proceeds of crime - and the Nigerian government, which is receiving the money more in form of aid. Returning the money to Delta state under whatever guise would invalidate all the hard work done by the UK authorities in investigating, prosecuting and confiscating the funds as it would be tantamount to handing it back to Ibori, since he still controls all levers of power in the state. Besides, the Delta state government, like Justice Gabriel Kolawole avers in the case seeking the permanent forfeiture of the $15 million Ibori bribe to Ribadu, simply acquiesced or at best, is a collaborator in the looting of its own funds.
 Neither does the federal government deserve the money because it has consistently failed to hold Ibori and other criminals within its ranks accountable. This is a government that sat idly as a thrice convicted criminal both in the UK and in Nigeria bulldozed his way to the Delta state government house and almost bulldozed his way to the presidency were it not for fate that stopped him. Even when his conviction history became public knowledge, all courts in the land – right up to the Supreme Court – could not muster the courage to declare him an ex-convict and therefore ineligible to occupy such high office in Nigeria. They used all kinds of asinine and shameful arguments to let him off the hook.
Or is it the prosecution authorities or the courts that corruptly allowed Ibori walk free from over 170 count corruption charges against him? Like his convict case that went right up to the Supreme Court, Ibori was discharged and acquitted in 2009 when the judge – Marcel Awokulehin – pronounced that there was “no clear evidence to support the charges.” Yet the same Ibori promptly pled guilty in the UK to avoid a trial and the lengthy prison term that will entail. He has served his time in jail and is now back in Delta parading himself as king. The utter shamelessness of a government that harbours and celebrates criminals while begging to receive their confiscated loot from other countries shouldn’t be lost on us. Truth is, in Nigeria, the highly connected criminal is almost certain to escape justice and accountability even if his/her misdeeds were captured on video. The Nigerian state and judiciary is set up to ensure that.
The first instalment of £4.2 million recovered loot has been handed over to the federal government and there is nothing anyone can do about it now. But there is a much bigger one on the way. UK prosecutors are currently asking a court for a confiscation order against Ibori of £117.7 million ($163.8 million), a Bentley and a Bombardier Challenger jet. That is what the Nigerian civil society and conscientious objectors should be more concerned about. We must impress it on the British government that there is a far better way Ibori’s loots could be spent that could transform the lives of hundreds and thousands of Delta state people whose resources have been and continues to be recklessly pillaged by their state government and its crook-in-chief, Ibori.
Instead of handing that money to an irresponsible government that aids and abets criminals, the UK government can set up an Ibori loot foundation. This money can be invested in perpetuity and the proceeds used to train teachers for Delta state schools, give scholarships to brilliant but indigent students of the states from primary to university levels within and outside the country. Both the federal and Delta state governments could be allowed to sit on the board of this foundation if they so desire. This will be a far better use of the recovered loot than subsidising a corrupt and irresponsible government and so-called infrastructure projects that are often over-inflated, riddled with corruption and of dubious quality.
What is more, this will be a legal and fitting way to remember Ibori in perpetuity. Since the Nigerian and the Delta state governments have permanently shirked their responsibilities of bringing Ibori to account and are rather collaborators in the looting of the resources of the state, such a move – which the UK government have both a legal and moral authority to do - will remain an eternal rebuke to Ibori and to the governments. It will also help to salvage 100s and 1000s of children in the state whose futures have been stolen and destroyed by the greed of Ibori and his collaborators.   
6/3/21, 14:26 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Indeed a great thought but, how does this get out to the right folks (UK Govt.) who will set the loot foundation up?
6/3/21, 14:27 - +234 803 075 0650: We're tagging them and making representations to the UK high commission in Nigeria
6/3/21, 14:29 - Kenneth Maths. US.: You are doing well.....just remember not to step into Nigeria in the next 20years
6/3/21, 14:29 - Kenneth Maths. US.: ....and of course any of your family member😁
6/3/21, 14:30 - +234 803 075 0650: You guys would have to grant me asylum here then🤪
6/3/21, 14:32 - Kenneth Maths. US.: That one na small thing....You need to apply first sha b4 we grant you one🤣🤣
6/3/21, 18:08 - +234 802 474 1100: Thanks MR and Mrs Adewoye!!!

Amen
6/3/21, 18:09 - +234 802 474 1100: Chris ehn... lemme ask a question....
All these things we are doing sha... protests, write ups etc... Do we really think we are having an effect..

Left to me, make we all just hollup until the next election
6/3/21, 18:09 - +234 802 474 1100: We failed this exam terribly. We will just repeat the class on 2023
6/3/21, 18:14 - +234 803 075 0650: Well, it's easy to fall into despair. The main aim is to educate the populace and spur them into action. Besides, things would have been far more worse than this without the shouting and constant criticisms. They'd have turned Nigeria into an open air prison already
6/3/21, 18:28 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): If we failed exams terribly in the last two elections, what guarantees do you have that we will pass in 2023? Especially if you are studying with the same past questions as before?
6/3/21, 18:30 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Completely agree with you. With the noise, these people are still doing all this rubbish. Imagine if no one was shouting
6/3/21, 18:31 - +234 802 474 1100: Me I don’t know how much worse things can be o...

Like 1% less worse maybe 😄
6/3/21, 18:32 - +234 802 474 1100: More worse *
6/3/21, 18:32 - +234 802 474 1100: Wo. That English yaff confuse me sef
6/3/21, 18:33 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): There's a saying that it's someone who can speak that is able to say he has no words. Things can ALWAYS be worse
6/3/21, 18:33 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Talk am for pidgin abeg 😅
6/3/21, 18:33 - +234 802 474 1100: Teeny bit worse 😀
6/3/21, 18:34 - +234 802 474 1100: 2more years ... almost there...
6/3/21, 18:34 - +234 803 075 0650: We thought we couldn't gave it any worse under Jonathan until we elected this buffoon. If you knew the number of bills proposed to totally take away your freedom of expression and association that our shouting has made them quickly abandon, you won't be saying what you're saying
6/3/21, 18:35 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): United Alkebulian Republic abi na wetin them wan call una? 🤣
6/4/21, 01:06 - Kenneth Maths. US.: <Media omitted>
6/4/21, 01:11 - +234 803 075 0650: This is the exact words of the constitution:

 
"If the Federation is at war in which the territory of Nigeria is physically involved
and the President considers that it is not practicable to hold elections, the
National Assembly may by resolution extend the period of four years mentioned
in subsection (2) of this section from time to time; but no such extension shall
exceed a period of six months at any one time"
6/4/21, 01:11 - +234 803 075 0650: We may be stuck with Buhari longer than we think
6/4/21, 01:24 - +234 803 075 0650: They're already talking about declaring a state of emergency and suspending the constitution. So @2348024741100, the 2023 election is not a given. The constitution and the entire democratic order can easily be tossed away
6/4/21, 01:25 - Kenneth Maths. US.: It is the same thing with the yellow background na....abi?
6/4/21, 01:25 - +234 803 075 0650: Yes
6/4/21, 05:07 - Dee: 🙂 i swear people just like trouble. This section was cleverly quoted out of context. 

This section was talking about the dissolution of the senate and house of assembly every 4 years. 

It then said that if the federation is at war, and the president considers it not practical to hold an election, then, the national assembly may by resolution extend the period of 4 years ( not for the president but their own dissolution) from time to time, but not beyond a period of 6 months at any one time. 

It is in 64(2) under procedure for summoning and dissolution of the national assembly

6/4/21, 05:07 - Dee: <Media omitted>
6/4/21, 05:08 - Dee: This is the constitution itself
6/4/21, 05:08 - Dee: I think some smart people are just trying to use it to scare the rest of us
6/4/21, 05:11 - +234 803 075 0650: Have you read recently that the Attorney general and Minister of justice wrote a memo to the president asking him to suspend the constitution so that he can have wide powers to deal with the insecurity in the country? Although he denied the report, it is clearly a smokescreen to test the waters
6/4/21, 05:14 - Dee: You don't follow, they may or may not be planning all sorts. We will never know the truth because politics is dirty and both sides play it very well. 

All I am saying is this one that Kenneth posted, was quoted out of context to get people scared and talking. 

That passage wasn't talking about the president extending his term. It was talking about the term of the senate and house.
6/4/21, 08:09 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: All I know is, Abeg anybody get house for Ghana? In case we need to use basket comot for night like Paul.

What if the pilot is drinking at home while flying remotely? Or he/she is attending to her young baby while flying? Or went clubbing the night before and is dozing on his chair? 

Lai lai. Na the hostesses gan gan go do tatafo for the passengers.

6/4/21, 13:24 - +234 803 075 0650: But on a serious note, we're in deep trouble and nothing will happen except if there's an implosion. I don't see that happening anytime soon and nobody will do anything to help us.
For now, the only concern of the US & EU is stability. They don't want any refugee crisis so they won't pressure or push Buhari hard even if he abolishes the constitution and declares himself president for life. We're on our own
6/4/21, 13:27 - Kenneth Maths. US.: @2348127379568 the signs are here😁

6/4/21, 17:20 - +234 803 075 0650: OK. The Nigerian government has banned Twitter in Nigeria for deleting Buhari's hate tweet. I told you all we're on our own. They can shut down the internet, suspend the constitution and refuse to hold elections and nothing will happen
6/4/21, 17:25 - +234 802 474 1100: It’s a joke jare
6/4/21, 17:25 - +234 802 474 1100: April fool

6/4/21, 17:26 - Ini Eket: We Sha should also start planning backup means of communication because e fit reach instagram and whatsapp at this rate
6/4/21, 17:27 - Benedict: Lemme go and pay 1 year subscription for a VPN service sharply
6/4/21, 17:27 - Benedict: They can mandate telcos and all Internet service providers to block all traffic to the site
6/4/21, 17:27 - Ini Eket: D ISPs, they hv mandated NBC for nw, but it's d ISPs that can implement I guess
6/4/21, 17:28 - Benedict: They have also mandated social media companies to be licenced 🤦🏾‍♂️

6/4/21, 17:34 - +234 803 075 0650: OK. Keep watching. I'm telling you these fellows have gone mad. They don't care. They're ready to destroy the country- and they know no one can stop them. Europe and America are more intrested in stability and stopping immigration
6/4/21, 17:34 - Benedict: It's a nice contrast to Chris😂
6/4/21, 17:39 - +234 802 474 1100: Nah! I don’t see the Armageddon people are painting.

if indeed there was a crisis... it’s only a matter of hours before air traffic is grounded... borders are manned... etc
6/4/21, 17:49 - +234 802 971 7134: I’m sure nobody believed a civil war will happen
6/4/21, 17:49 - +234 802 474 1100: All this one wey we Dey do na talk...
Then the heightened fear that it takes for you to be ready for something like that... you might as well be at war already
6/4/21, 17:49 - +234 802 971 7134: Preparation is key. Always guiding
6/4/21, 17:49 - +234 802 474 1100: Preparing for war isn’t living
6/4/21, 17:49 - +234 803 075 0650: Nigeria's borders are not secured. There are over 1000 entry and exit points out of the country
6/4/21, 17:49 - +234 802 971 7134: Better safe than sorry
6/4/21, 17:49 - +234 802 474 1100: It’s also war
6/4/21, 17:49 - +234 802 971 7134: But it’s the reality
6/4/21, 17:50 - +234 802 971 7134: Nobody is stoking fires here or raising false alarm. They are valid concerns
6/4/21, 17:50 - +234 802 474 1100: Dude don’t focus on the fine details... I get the broad picture
6/4/21, 17:50 - +234 802 474 1100: Yeah I agree... valid concerns...
6/4/21, 17:51 - +234 802 971 7134: and this government has shown it doesn’t send.
6/4/21, 17:52 - +234 802 474 1100: Let me raise a data to make a point

I think(Chris help me confirm) that the number of people who have been killed by gun violence in the US this year exceed that killed by « terrorism » in Nigeria this year
6/4/21, 17:52 - +234 802 971 7134: Nope

6/4/21, 17:55 - +234 802 971 7134: Would you rather go to Maiduguri or south side Chicago?
6/4/21, 17:55 - +234 802 474 1100: Lol... My dads younger brother actually lives and works there
6/4/21, 17:56 - +234 802 971 7134: Maiduguri or Chicago?

6/4/21, 17:59 - +234 802 971 7134: But whose rates have skyrocketed?
6/4/21, 17:59 - +234 802 474 1100: Lol... my point isn’t that things aren’t bad.

My point is na who sabi tell him story pass na him win
6/4/21, 18:00 - +234 802 971 7134: It’s not about story telling my brother. It’s about how bad things have become
6/4/21, 18:00 - +234 802 971 7134: We have left story telling since.
6/4/21, 18:00 - +234 802 474 1100: As far as the US is concerned the deaths are about the 2nd amendment.... meanwhile 1.6m people have died form gun violence from 1968 -2011 (Wiki)
6/4/21, 18:01 - +234 802 474 1100: That’s about as much casualty in a civil war
6/4/21, 18:01 - +234 802 474 1100: But here we are .... it is still the land of the free and home of the brave
6/4/21, 18:02 - +234 802 971 7134: So what would you approximate the number of deaths from terrorism and insurgency to be
6/4/21, 18:02 - +234 802 474 1100: « Just » over 1.6m
6/4/21, 18:02 - +234 802 474 1100: No mind me
6/4/21, 18:02 - +234 802 971 7134: About 32k per year

6/4/21, 18:03 - +234 802 474 1100: But all I’m saying is.... The whole world is in turmoil... let’s not be naive to thing we can hide from it by simply relocating
6/4/21, 18:03 - +234 802 971 7134: When you make someone’s home unlivable. Take their means of livelihood. Make them refugees in their own country. Are they not dead?
6/4/21, 18:04 - +234 803 075 0650: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
6/4/21, 18:04 - +234 802 474 1100: Bros... as you Dey relocate your immediate family, you go relocate your extended, your sisters, your brothers, your parents join...
6/4/21, 18:04 - +234 803 075 0650: Odenigbo and his excessive optimism
6/4/21, 18:05 - +234 802 971 7134: Relocation or immigration is a choice. My problem is the undeserved optimism.
6/4/21, 18:05 - +234 802 971 7134: WIP
6/4/21, 18:05 - +234 802 474 1100: 😂😂

6/4/21, 18:09 - +234 802 474 1100: I am not speaking from a place of aloofness

It’s just realism that a call to abandon the country is rooted in emotion and isn’t practical
6/4/21, 18:09 - +234 802 971 7134: Bro pls send your children and your wife. You can remain o
6/4/21, 18:09 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Its OK to have mad love and great optimism for Nigeria. It's a choice.

My only problem is the knee jerk mass exodus reaction
6/4/21, 18:17 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Just be telling this story because the calm u r looking for will not show
6/4/21, 18:17 - +234 802 474 1100: I know the story already 😃
6/4/21, 18:17 - +234 802 971 7134: I don’t think any reaction to naija is knee jerk
6/4/21, 18:17 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Does it pay you in the long run?
6/4/21, 18:17 - +234 802 971 7134: Except you’re insulated from the problems
6/4/21, 18:17 - Bootylicious Honeypie: I dont think the exodus just started today sha
6/4/21, 18:17 - +234 802 474 1100: A relocation to Canada at this time. Nope
6/4/21, 18:17 - +234 803 075 0650: OK

6/4/21, 18:18 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Alright
6/4/21, 18:18 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Mtseewwwwww, Odenigbo!
6/4/21, 18:18 - +234 803 075 0650: In Nigeria,  once in a while, I seem to black out, lose sensation in one part of my body and pass out. I'm rushed to the hospital and I often vividly describe the symptoms,  but in all cases, I'm treated for typhoid and malaria and told to rest and then discharged
6/4/21, 18:19 - +234 802 474 1100: I told you I knew the story...😀
6/4/21, 18:19 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Ghegeun!!!
6/4/21, 18:19 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Abeg I don’t know carry on!
6/4/21, 18:19 - +234 802 971 7134: I guess it’s different strokes sha
6/4/21, 18:19 - +234 803 075 0650: Two weeks before I came to the US, I'd one of such symptoms and was rushed to the hospital. But I was tested for malaria and typhoid and was both negative. The doctors couldn't deal with my case and invited a senior consultant. I spent almost a week at the hospital but got absolutely no diagnosis. During that time, my BP (I inherited High BP from my family and I'm constantly on medication) was very normal without taking the drugs. The consultant ordered me to stop the drugs.
6/4/21, 18:20 - +234 802 971 7134: But you know say e get how things go bad whatever youre scared of leaving in naija to go start again fit scatter?
6/4/21, 18:20 - +234 803 075 0650: [30/05, 1:44 pm] Chris Akor: Of course I check my BP everyday and I didn't need any doctor to advise me to go back to the drugs after two weeks when my BP started spiking

[30/05, 1:47 pm] Chris Akor: Fast forward to November last year. I was doing my daily jogging as I always do to keep myself healthy. I experienced the numbing symptoms again and almost collapsed. I dragged myself to a point I could sit and was rushed to the Emergency room. Within 30 minutes, I was diagnosed with minor stroke. The tests also showed I've had several episodes before but that if this isn't taken care of, I was heading for a major disaster.

[30/05, 1:48 pm] Chris Akor: Further tests and analyses showed a hole in my heart (from birth) which hasn't been closed as for most people and may be responsible for blood clot and consequent stroke.

[30/05, 1:53 pm] Chris Akor: To cut long story short, I've been on expert medication to manage my condition and Thursday last week, I had a heart procedure to close the hole in my heart.
So, the summary of this long epistle is that living in Nigeria is an extreme sport. 
With all your dreams, patriotism and undying vision to change the country,  you stand the risk of dying suddenly from the minute of health issues

[30/05, 1:54 pm] Chris Akor: I always quarrel with my wife that I won't live outside Nigeria. But right now, I can't sustain that argument anymore because reality has thought me a lesson
[30/05, 2:02 pm] Chris Akor: And truly, I've been given another shot at life here in the US. I will henceforth be more circumspect about living in Nigeria. It's not lack of patriotism or fear or weakness. Sometimes,  it's just because we want to be alive. I believe I'm more useful to Nigeria alive than dead
6/4/21, 18:21 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: E dey Abidjan na, dey advise people to have faith in UAR.
6/4/21, 18:21 - +234 802 971 7134: Na why I say the thing dey pain me
6/4/21, 18:21 - +234 802 474 1100: Bros... as I sais when we spoke... I’m really glad about this! Truly world class healthcare which we unfortunately don’t have
6/4/21, 18:22 - +234 802 474 1100: But there are maybe almost 100 similar countries in the world where it would have also been undiagnosed for years
6/4/21, 18:22 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: E and govt now wetin be d difference? E go do pass Dino Melaye if e enter senate
6/4/21, 18:22 - +234 802 971 7134: I disagree. Cos dem no even check for anything

6/4/21, 18:24 - +234 802 474 1100: Half the world has poor access to healthcare... 
it is a hefty challenge but one that can only be solved by improving the healthcare systems in those countries... not by abandoning those countries. Cold hard truth
6/4/21, 18:24 - +234 802 971 7134: You are looking at naija from a pan African view
6/4/21, 18:25 - +234 802 971 7134: Pls immerse yourself as a Nigerian
6/4/21, 18:25 - +234 802 971 7134: Is misdiagnosis the same as doctors on strike
6/4/21, 18:25 - +234 802 474 1100: Else this one wey white nationalism all across the word is rising... it will become worse when they seem more people from shit hole countries not fixing their countries but coming to enjoy what « they sweated » for
6/4/21, 18:25 - +234 802 971 7134: Or no you can’t get a bed unless you know someone
6/4/21, 18:25 - Bootylicious Honeypie: How do you "improve the healthcare systems"?

6/4/21, 18:26 - Dee: Let me simplify it for you guys.  Whether you believe naija is going down the drain or not, doesn't change the best decision in this case.

Treat your "Plan B" like condoms. Better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it.
6/4/21, 18:26 - +234 802 971 7134: Which sweat
6/4/21, 18:27 - +234 802 474 1100: It’s the work that has become the core of what I would like to devote myself to! And am doing.

And it’s the same across other sectors! If no skilled people remain to do it... it won’t get done
6/4/21, 18:27 - +234 802 971 7134: Lol
6/4/21, 18:27 - +234 802 474 1100: We’lol keep building countries that’ll never fully integrate us
6/4/21, 18:27 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: I will take the message and leave the choice of example🧐🧐🧐
6/4/21, 18:27 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Are you in Nigeria getting this done?
6/4/21, 18:27 - +234 802 971 7134: It’s not for me. It’s for my kids
6/4/21, 18:28 - Dee: I sha simplified it for "the guys"
6/4/21, 18:30 - +234 802 474 1100: Yes technically ... it’s all interconnected honestly...

I’m just challenging the single story of the « end of the world » ....
6/4/21, 18:33 - +234 802 474 1100: If you do the analysis and it pays you... certainly
6/4/21, 18:33 - +234 802 971 7134: Your message Dey change color bro

6/4/21, 18:34 - Bootylicious Honeypie: <Media omitted>
6/4/21, 18:35 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Perhaps the analysis just happens to fit the plan of a lot of people?🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
6/4/21, 18:35 - +234 802 971 7134: Naija no be knee jerk sha
6/4/21, 18:36 - +234 802 474 1100: Then if that’s correct... no wahala... but not to couch it under the guise of .... « I left just as they were about to bomb Nigeria »
6/4/21, 18:36 - +234 802 971 7134: It’s human nature to run away from what threatens you
6/4/21, 18:36 - +234 802 971 7134: But as you be Okadigbo abi Wetin your wife call you I understand. He who runs lives to fight another day
6/4/21, 18:37 - Bootylicious Honeypie: I believe most people have done the math and are making the decision based on what they consider best for their families. 

Whether it's an "about to bomb nigeria" reason or not...its what they see as best to do at this time.
6/4/21, 18:37 - +234 802 474 1100: 😀
Odenigbo.... a character in half of a yellow sun i think..
6/4/21, 18:38 - +234 802 971 7134: Oh yea. That was Chiwetel
6/4/21, 18:38 - +234 802 474 1100: Agreed... just that they have formed their opinions on only one side of the pessimistic analysis !!! 🤪
6/4/21, 18:38 - +234 802 474 1100: They haven’t read the whole scenario planning document
6/4/21, 18:39 - +234 802 971 7134: I will write to your office to create a branch for you in ApApa. You need to be in the thick of things
6/4/21, 18:39 - +234 802 474 1100: Half of the US believes that there was going to be a civil war last year...

Just to drop this side piece of info
6/4/21, 18:39 - +234 802 474 1100: Believed*
6/4/21, 18:40 - +234 802 971 7134: Those half were red heads that believe Trump is still president and Hillary drinks blood
6/4/21, 18:40 - +234 802 474 1100: The decision is about as good as the information source
6/4/21, 18:40 - +234 802 474 1100: You are making my point
6/4/21, 18:40 - +234 802 971 7134: Na dem Kenneth people na
6/4/21, 18:40 - +234 802 474 1100: That’s the information they wey provided
6/4/21, 18:41 - +234 802 971 7134: Are we provided information about naija or we are seeing and experiencing it?
6/4/21, 18:41 - +234 802 971 7134: 2 different things o
6/4/21, 18:41 - +234 802 971 7134: I’m sure everyone here has multiple nasty stories about naija
6/4/21, 18:41 - +234 802 971 7134: Have you heard how clueless those Red heads are?
6/4/21, 18:42 - +234 802 971 7134: Or even spoken to any of them?
6/4/21, 18:42 - +234 802 474 1100: Watch Fox News for Nasty stories from the other perspective.... real events that show black murderous people and tell me why you won’t believe black people are shit
6/4/21, 18:42 - +234 802 474 1100: Just saying!!! Mass hysteria is a real thing
6/4/21, 18:43 - +234 802 474 1100: We are all not immune
6/4/21, 18:43 - +234 802 971 7134: And I’m saying we are not relying on Fox.  We are living those realities
6/4/21, 18:43 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Look at it this way...

Possibility A: Nothing happens to Nigeria and everything is fine...no bomb goes off.

Those who left MAY, have a better life, better healthcare etc. OR not do so well financially but still have better standard of loving.

Those who stayed back MAY earn more money from businesses OR things remain as they have been...


Possibility B: Nigeria does get worse.

Plot in the possible scenarios and pock which one is a better option
6/4/21, 18:44 - +234 802 971 7134: I’m not watching AIT to hear about things. I’m experiencing it. Food is expensive. Hospitals non existent

6/5/21, 11:38 - +234 802 474 1100: Thanks for that information. It was necessary to hear that.

We have a problem! Everyone on here agrees. Nigeria ain’t right. The way a story is told sometimes justifies the next steps. For some the solution is to relocate, for others it’s burn down the country and yet others it is to get involved and find a solution. Choose your path!
6/5/21, 11:46 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): And for others still, it is to relocate + burn the place down or relocate + find a solution. The options are not mutually exclusive 🤧 Plus some of us are out here chasing money, minding our business 😄

6/5/21, 14:26 - +234 803 075 0650: But @2348024741100 do you realise diaspora Nigerians are the single most important people in Nigeria right now. Their remittances is higher than Nigeria's combined earnings from oil. The government is begging and even bribing them with N5/dollar to continue sending the dollar home. Can you ever imagine what Nigeria would have become without the billions of dollars diaspora Nigerians send home?
6/5/21, 14:27 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: I hear the president is also quite accessible, my colleagues that went on holiday said they met one of the cabinet members, that one was now gisting with them and asked them to greet Dino as if the way e dey follow dem gist na d way our own politicians dey accessible🤦🏽‍♀️
6/5/21, 14:36 - +234 802 474 1100: Following the argument down the slippery slope ... we should just empty Nigeria, live in other countries and earn even more In diaspora
6/5/21, 14:39 - +234 803 075 0650: That's no argument here. Even 2 million people can't leave. And you know t

So that @2348024741100 wee not start getting mad from here
6/5/21, 16:25 - +234 803 072 5702: Lol…abeg give dem my address. I’ve made more tweets today than any other day😁
6/5/21, 16:41 - +234 803 075 0650: @2348024741100 this is how you destroy a country - when you think critics are just making noise for nothing. The government ultimately gets emboldened and go on a destruction spree. So long as the citizens can't stop it, it will continue until it destroys the society or remake it in its image.
6/5/21, 16:48 - +234 803 075 0650: The moment I knew this government was evil was around 2017 when I got to learn Buhari's media aide (Femi Adesina) was putting pressure on BusinessDay to fire me and when he didn't succeed, started threatening the organization that the government won't do business with it again
6/5/21, 16:53 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Another angu: the timing and rationale behind the twitter ban is to take attention away from other critical issues - kidnapping, tribalist threat the president issued, herdsmen, 2 months court strike
6/5/21, 16:53 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): You know we have short term memory in this country
6/5/21, 16:54 - +234 803 075 0650: It can't take attention away o. It's the government going rogue. They don't care. There's nothing anybody can do really. We're trapped with this government
6/5/21, 16:55 - +234 802 474 1100: Another misinterpretation of my stand...
My stand is simple... much like what the US went through. We elected the wrong person, unfortunately twice... but we get a chance in a couple of years to make a better choice...

All other screams to go and die on the streets right now does not change the fact that we elect in a couple of years. This is the underlying fact that the democrats got quite clearly the past 4yrs
6/5/21, 16:56 - +234 802 474 1100: In the meantime let us make progress on enablers of a better choice... better healthcare, education reform within the framework of the government we have now.. 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
6/5/21, 16:57 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Eugene oh, stop drawing parallels between US democracy and Naija democracy! In the US, there are systems and institutional structures that function
6/5/21, 16:58 - +234 802 474 1100: The outrage is nice! Needed! But anyone involved should have thy context in mind... it is a means towards changing public opinion and possibly electing better
6/5/21, 16:58 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Not saying everyone should go die on the street. But saying that we get our chance to make a change in 2 years is trivializing the issue at hand
6/5/21, 16:58 - +234 802 474 1100: What is the counter proposal?
6/5/21, 16:59 - +234 802 474 1100: I like to boil down complex issues to strategic scenarios and decisions... less emotion
6/5/21, 16:59 - +234 802 474 1100: Help me see what other options exist... possibly my blindside
6/5/21, 17:00 - +234 802 474 1100: Plus this outrage worked well to make change public opinion against Jonathan... too well infact... it’s an age old truism
6/5/21, 17:00 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): I am not making a counter proposal. I am saying deal with the Nigerian democracy as it is not as you wish it to be. Start with history + the governments you ruling party use as a model then make your projections from there. We are a federalist state in name only
6/5/21, 17:00 - +234 802 474 1100: And I agree
6/5/21, 17:01 - +234 802 474 1100: It still comes down to the actions people take... what action? Are we asking our people to take for their future? That’s the only thing we CAN do
6/5/21, 17:03 - +234 802 474 1100: But I can’t help but use Trump as an example. At some point you have to accept that your outrage is only to hold the fort until you CAN change the situation within the framework of the laws you have
6/5/21, 17:07 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Why are grown adults who should be able to educate themselves politically waiting for others to tell them which way to lean? In the America you speak of, for better or worse, people have their own political convictions. In Nigeria, na to jump from one incident to the next. Come 2023, the it will still be a mess! We never ready
6/5/21, 17:10 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Buhari and his people are looking to China as worthy partners and possibly political role model for how a government deals with its people. So yes, wait for the constitutional opportunity which is elections. But know that it is not that straightforward. Who would be the candidates for presidency in 2023? Do we have an inkling? If no, how does that inspire hope for a change?
6/5/21, 17:10 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Abeg, make I face my weekend chilling
6/5/21, 17:11 - +234 802 474 1100: Again I agree it isn’t perfect...

But I still hear no other options; beyond the running away bit...
6/5/21, 17:11 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): We never even face local and state government...
6/5/21, 17:13 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): So instead of thinking what the likely alternatives could be, you don't. Na to follow path of least resistance I.e.wait for elections? And when that doesn't work, we chill and wait another four years?
6/5/21, 17:13 - +234 802 474 1100: You never talk the option na
6/5/21, 17:14 - Dee: We could shoot all of them. From the president down to the local government chairman.  Also include past leaders for the past 10 years. Start afresh. 

That is am option.
6/5/21, 17:14 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): I can admit that I have not and probably will not spend energy to figure out what the effective Nigeria solution is. Can you?
6/5/21, 17:14 - +234 802 474 1100: 😀😀😂

Just in case anyone is monitoring this chat... I don’t know him o
6/5/21, 17:15 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): As a Catholic with the consciousness that murder is a sin, I will seriously consider investing in this venture 😄
6/5/21, 17:17 - +234 802 474 1100: Lol... you are afraid to say it!!
Any solution lies after electoral change.

Except you are one of those that believe in wars and strife. That’s the only other option
6/5/21, 17:18 - Dee: 😀 I don't know myself either. 

But I have options if it gets to that.

 I can always claim a gorilla took my phone and sent those messages. 

Or a snake swallowed my phone and used it's stomach muscles to send the message. 

Or I could faint during questioning. 

Or put my entire body from head to toe in a cast. Leaving only my mouth open. cos man gast eat. 

I have options. I will go free.
6/5/21, 17:19 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): It's amazing how you alone know what's in my mind Eugene 😄. What I have is a complete loss of faith in the electoral process
6/5/21, 17:19 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): 🤣
6/5/21, 17:19 - +234 802 474 1100: 😂😂😂
6/5/21, 17:20 - Dee: I promise we will do sign of the cross,before we shoot them. Bless it and all.
6/5/21, 17:20 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): I like how you have plans Dee
6/5/21, 17:21 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): I'll just tell myself the lies those crusaders told themselves way back: it is God's work 🤧
6/5/21, 17:24 - Dee: 😀😀 you know, I can actually make that work. Claim we are doing God's work. 

If some Nigerians could believe Trump was the messiah, sent by God to deliver us from  demons, I can definitely pull this off.
6/5/21, 17:46 - +234 803 075 0650: Election is but a single step in the democratic and electoral value chain. There are series of steps before and after elections citizens ought to take to safeguard their democracy. If these aren't done, elections lose their meaning and become only a means of legitimizing tyrannical rule
6/5/21, 17:53 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): 😃 Ah! Humanity is a case study. Nigerians even more so
6/5/21, 17:56 - +234 802 474 1100: Agreed tooo
6/5/21, 17:58 - +234 803 075 0650: Nigerians aren't doing enough except the occasional burst of protests. Jonathan being the gentleman, deliberately enhanced those processes and that was why we were able to kick him out in the first place. With this man, it is not possible to achieve any democratic goal
6/5/21, 18:04 - Dee: Hmmm, not sure "Gentleman " is the word I would use to describe him. He was just as corrupt as this current government
6/5/21, 18:05 - +234 802 474 1100: Unfortunately we have to.

Various electoral laws that stifle voting and turnout across the world occur. But still the electoral process needs to be followed. This is ours! We need to own it and still make the changes despite our reality.
6/5/21, 18:06 - +234 803 075 0650: Well, what I know is that there are people within his government that were stupendously corrupt and he didn't do anything about them. But he clearly wanted to build institutions. He wanted Nigerians to really chose their leaders and not just vote
6/5/21, 18:20 - +234 803 075 0650: And our main problem is the absence or weakness of strong institutions. It means also that Jonathan was the most genuine leader we've ever had in Nigeria, because he worked genuinely to build institutions. But we were more obsessed with corruption than the real problem. Now, every institution has simply been destroyed and we must start from afresh if we ever have the chance again
6/5/21, 18:22 - +234 803 075 0650: The funny thing is that the mega corruption going on now dwarfs anything we saw during Jonathan's time. But we can't even make noise again because we've been beaten to submission
6/5/21, 18:29 - +234 803 075 0650: How can you complain about corruption when your very life is at risk of being yanked away any minute, when kidnappers are prowling the streets to grab you at the earliest opportunity and when there'sre threats of wars everywhere?
6/5/21, 18:30 - +234 803 075 0650: This is what is called ONE CHANCE

6/10/21, 05:11 - +234 803 075 0650: Nigeria is unravelling; but this time, we’re on our own
Christopher Akor
If, as all political scientists agree, the most distinctive characteristic of the state is the monopoly of the use of force, then Nigeria has failed. It is buffeted by insecurity from all sides. The ragtag but deadly terrorist group, Boko Haram (now routed and supplanted by the deadlier but well organised Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP)) have held sway in the northeast, effectively challenging the legitimacy of the state. Across the entire northwest, bandits roam the states killing, terrorising and kidnapping people unchallenged. Marauding Fulani herdsmen have laid siege to the peoples across north central Nigeria massacring them at will even as the government conveniently looks away and threatens the people being killed to give up their land or face more killings.  In other parts of the country, kidnapping for ransom is the new normal.
  Even as the military is stretched tin and has shown clear signs of incompetence and incapacity to make a dent on the insecurity in the country, a politically and emotionally insensitive president has been stocking the flames of disunity by his appointments, policies and uncouth utterances.   For instance, while killings by Islamic terrorists, Fulani herdsmen and kidnappings have continued unchallenged, the government has deployed disproportionate and lethal force in dealing with an irritating but otherwise peaceful group of separatists in the south east of the country. Since 2017, it has employed extrajudicial murders and assassinations in trying to suppress the group - Independent People of Biafra (IPOB). The unintended consequences was that the government turned the leader of the group – someone considered rude, tactless and a rabble-rouser – into a hero and the group has now taken up arms against the state, worsening the insecurity in the country. Even the relatively peaceful southwest region is currently being racked by separatist agitations.
It is not just security alone. Virtually all socio-economic indices rank Nigeria as one of the worst run countries on earth. The economy has gone into recession a record third time in six years.  In 2018, the country overtook India as the World Poverty Capital with a record 87 million of its citizens living in extreme poverty and six Nigerians slipping into extreme poverty every minute. Unemployment rate is the second highest globally at 33.3% with youth unemployment at a record-breaking 54.40%. The country also has the highest number of out of school children in the world at 13.2 million, and has one of the worst maternal mortality rate and health outcomes globally. The fragile state index ranked Nigeria 12th with a score of 98.0 while the relatively new Chandler Good Governance Index ranks it 102 out of 104, making it the third worst governed country in the world. Nigeria currently is like the state of nature where life is nasty, brutish and short. Functionally or empirically, the Nigerian state has failed. It remains a state today only because of juridical recognition.
 
Changing priorities
Despite the worsening security and economic conditions however, the government is more interested in regulating and banning social media, outlawing protests and dissents, shrinking the civic space, dismantling all democratic institutions and becoming an authoritarian government.
Luckily for it and unlike previous times, there has been a shift or change in priorities by Western countries. Since the early 1990s, the West has forced through an era of democratisation that saw the dismantling of many authoritarian systems in Africa. They kept the pressure on Nigeria and other laggard countries to ensure their fragile democracies work and that they respect human rights. However, recent events and the internal politics of Western countries, which is being heavily influenced by a resurgence of far right ideology, have shifted their priorities to immigration, counterterrorism and China. The Trump administration heralded this shift when it jettisoned America’s long-held foreign policy goals of promoting democracy and human rights for his ‘America First’ policy. Nowhere is this felt more than in relations with Mexico where Trump got Mexico to guard its border with the US and prevent the influx of Central Americans in exchange for America staying out of its business completely.
Authoritarian systems took note and are exploiting this to the fullest. Turkey, for instance, has perfected the art of threatening the European Union with the release of hundreds of thousands of Middle Eastern refugees it is harbouring into the EU in the event of any disagreement. Of course, this sends the EU into hysteria.
Last month, after Spain allowed Brahim Ghali, leader of the Polisario Front, which campaigns for the independence of Western Sahara, into the country to be treated for Covid-19, Morocco got angry and sent Spain a warning by allowing over 8000 African migrants to cross into the Spanish town of Ceuta unimpeded. Spain and the EU went into panic, sending soldiers to contain the situation. Ghali promptly left Spain to placate Morocco.
Similarly, the US and EU, which have always pushed for a democratic transfer of power through credible elections in Congo DR chose to maintain stability over promoting democracy by accepting the results of an obviously rigged election in 2018.
 
Going rogue
The changing priority of the West and the Covid-19 lockdown encouraged the Nigerian government, which had always been flirting with authoritarianism all along, to go the whole hog. Haven gotten away with the October 20, 2020 massacre of protesters at Lekki, it is now baring its fangs on the rest of society, desperately trying to put an end even to the appearances of freedoms and rights guaranteed by the constitution. Virtually all democratic institutions (from the courts to parliaments) have been upended and function only to affirm the wishes of the government. There are no pretences anymore. Rumours of martial law and suspension of the constitution are everywhere. And like Turkey, Morocco and Mexico, the Nigerian government is using its huge population (over 209 million) and the massive global immigration catastrophe it could cause to blackmail the US, UK and EU into silence or inaction.  Even with the country coming apart at the seams, the government’s control of oil resources will still give it enough resources to continue to control the army and play an outsized role in the coming bedlam. No wonder despite fighting unwinnable wars on many fronts already, Buhari is still threatening war on the Southeast for daring to nurse separatist feelings.
Nigerians fighting for democracy and the respect of human rights have been accustomed to receiving strong support and help from the US, UK and EU. This time however, no such help is forthcoming. Priorities in these countries have changed and they will prefer stability to the promotion of democracy or human rights. For the first time since the end of the Cold War, we are on our own and must fight our battles ourselves.  
6/10/21, 20:34 - +234 802 474 1100: Behave yourself.....PMB 2021
6/10/21, 20:37 - +234 802 474 1100: Abeg Chris... Our president is mad! Handle him like a madman! He’s leaving in less than 2yrs... we can make it! We will make it.

Just watched his “pre-recorded” Arise news interview. And even in that one, they couldn’t edit out his ignorance 😀
6/10/21, 20:42 - +234 803 075 0650: I like your optimist that he will leave in 2 years time. But from his actions, I'm not so sure.
6/10/21, 20:43 - +234 802 474 1100: Nah... he will! It’s not optimism...
He won’t go easily like Trump, but he will
6/10/21, 20:44 - +234 802 474 1100: He won’t go easily, like trump...

Lemme put comma to make the sense I want to make 😀
6/10/21, 20:45 - +234 803 075 0650: OK. Wait until 6 months to election and they orchestrate a crisis and declare state of emergency  and suspend the constitution
6/10/21, 20:46 - +234 802 474 1100: Yeah... of course nothing is impossible under the sun.

But this is a very unlikely scenario considering we have more power hungry leaders around 😀😀
6/10/21, 20:47 - +234 803 075 0650: Roll in the military and all of them will retreat into their shell. Most of them are spineless cowards o
6/10/21, 20:48 - +234 802 474 1100: Maybe if Donald Trump is sworn-in in August.... likelihood increases 😃😃
6/10/21, 20:48 - +234 803 075 0650: The only people that guarantee our democracy- US, UK & the EU are no longer interested in the promotion of democracy
6/10/21, 20:49 - +234 803 075 0650: All the Nigerians jumping up and down as Democrats are just noisemakers. The real people behind our democracy are the west
6/10/21, 20:50 - +234 802 474 1100: That’s quite a claim man. I see you alluded to it in your write up. I guess they only started upholding “our democracy” after Abacha? 🤨

They have considerable influence, but nah, it’s ours to uphold, imperfect as it is...
6/10/21, 20:54 - +234 803 075 0650: Without them, Abacha wouldn't be gone, Abdulsalami wouldn't have handed over. The sanctions had effectively squeezed the government to a point of submission. And the west joined the opposition openly in subverting military rule. No foreign investment into Nigeria. Everything was stagnant and the only condition that is acceptable to them is return to democracy. See how Nigeria opened up the moment Obasanjo was sworn in....
6/10/21, 20:54 - +234 803 075 0650: INEC, political parties .... every of our democratic institution was influenced by the west
6/10/21, 20:56 - +234 803 075 0650: The same thing happened in Ghana and most African countries. Study about the wave of Democratisation
6/10/21, 20:58 - +234 802 474 1100: They really took their time then. All of 5yrs! 

I am on the same range on the spectrum with your point. They wield considerable influence. 

Just consider reviewing the claim about them guaranteeing our democracy and being the “real people” behind our democracy 
In the write up you used “strong support “ and I could live with that.
6/10/21, 21:00 - +234 802 474 1100: Anyways....
Our king has run mad...
Deal with him from that perspective...


And if he threatens not to leave in two years. Well that’s a different game with different rules. But until then.... we’ve got a mad king

6/12/21, 08:52 - +234 802 474 1100: There you go making a connection I didn’t explicitly make 😂😂
6/12/21, 08:53 - +234 803 075 0650: Assumptions aren't stated. They're not.
6/12/21, 08:53 - +234 803 075 0650: That's why they're assumptions
6/12/21, 08:53 - +234 802 474 1100: You’ve used the right word now... assumptions
6/12/21, 08:53 - +234 802 474 1100: Care to throw it out into the universe first to confirm?
6/12/21, 08:54 - +234 802 474 1100: It was just coincidental that I was reading that post when your cartoon post came in...

Nothing more. At least on my end.
6/12/21, 08:55 - +234 803 075 0650: But that is the building bloc of your argument and it is my duty to mention it. If the assumption is wrong, your argument  is also necessarily wrong
6/12/21, 08:55 - +234 802 474 1100: What’s my argument again?
6/12/21, 08:56 - +234 803 075 0650: That the dollar is taking a beating
6/12/21, 08:56 - +234 802 474 1100: I thought that was a fact I was simply sharing.
6/12/21, 08:57 - +234 802 474 1100: I shared inflation rate data. 
And then stated that the dollar was also taking a beating
6/12/21, 08:57 - +234 803 075 0650: No it's not. It's an opinion. Higher inflation figure was expected especially coming out of the pandemic
6/12/21, 09:01 - +234 802 474 1100: Ok..
So look I shared two bits of info.
1. The inflation rate is at 5% - fact
2: the dollar is taking a beating - you can look up data and forecasts on dollar performance against other currencies ... it’s not an opinion based comment.. they are eaither true of false
6/12/21, 09:04 - +234 802 474 1100: Sequence of events - your cartoon.
I laughed.
Then said btw - by the way ..... a segue into another conversation. 😜.

After all, Mat 7:7 says, and I quote :  

"Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened" 

Nothing about the number of times you can "ask" "seek" or "knock" there. So why is she seeing "demons" about "opening" when my guy is "knocking"?

6/13/21, 19:19 - +234 803 075 0650: This coalition government of  divergent and opposing ideology was driven by one sole aim - get Bibi out at all cost. But I don't see the government lasting. It could collapse any day from squabbles. Any one or two lawmakers withdraw and the government collapses. Bibi may be out for now, but I see him mounting a comeback soon
6/13/21, 19:29 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Another angle is interaction with and perception from other world leaders - one person is there for 2 years, how are you sure your understanding will be upheld in the following 2 years? Also, what happens in the next election? Still power sharing or these two will be at each other's throats (if they last)

In Nigeria, even the market women is overtaxed but sadly little or nothing of the tax reaches the government coffers. So we can't even debate the morality of tax in our context. It's just organized robbery
6/13/21, 21:12 - +234 802 474 1100: 😀 Truly exciting I agree

Prof Chris! Ever ready to put down Nigeria 😀😃🏃🏾🏃🏾

Disclaimer: I did not bring Nigeria into the matter o, you did.

But taking you up on the statement: two questions: which taxes do market women pay? 2. What do you mean by it doesn’t reach government coffers
6/13/21, 21:16 - +234 803 075 0650: All sorts of taxes. Daily even 😏😏😏
6/13/21, 21:17 - +234 802 474 1100: And then  a point on the comment that it doesn’t apply to us. It certainly does, there have been a few proposals and the Finance Bill 2021 with changes to taxation rates and laws is currently in the senate I believe. Massive repercussions for our tax system I think. The bill could benefit from robust debates such as this

You remind us that nations are built in between elections. Taxation is one of those such institutions! And please don’t bring the argument that money is not being used properly in Nigeria. 🙄

6/13/21, 21:21 - +234 803 075 0650: Oga I know the nexus between taxation and the social contract. Believe me. My point is that we don't even have the capacity to collect and remit the taxes so collected. We rather hire agents to do the collection for us and it's anything they remit that we take as paid taxes even if it is 5% of the tax collected or even 0%
6/13/21, 21:23 - +234 802 474 1100: I’m  exorcising demons 👽

6/17/21, 15:22 - +234 803 075 0650: ‘Lifeless’ Buhari finally wins Trump’s admiration!!!

Christopher Akor

The first and only time former President Trump met Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari  in April 2018 at the White House, Trump was so disappointed that, according to the Financial Times, he told “aides he never wanted to meet someone so lifeless again.” However, things have since changed and Buhari is now a model for Trump. This much was apparent in a statement from Trump on June 8 congratulating Nigeria “who just banned Twitter because they banned their President.”
Trump was naturally elated with the news that Nigeria promptly banned Twitter after it deleted a tweet by the Nigerian President for violating its policy on hate speech. Both Twitter and Facebook banned Trump from their networks for his role in the January 6 insurrection and storming of the Capitol. Even before then, Twitter was constantly deleting hateful, inaccurate and false tweets promoting disinformation and conspiracy theories by the then President and warned it may eventually suspend his account entirely after he leaves office. However, they felt he crossed the line on January 6th. While Twitter permanently banned Trump, Facebook, after recourse to its own “Supreme Court” of sorts, limited Trump’s ban to two years.
Even as President, Trump repeatedly made attempts to repeal section 230 of the 1996 United States Communications Decency Act that shields social media companies such as Twitter, Facebook and Google from liability for content their users post. He even signed an executive order attempting to curb some of the protections offered by section 230. Supporters of the law argued that it had allowed tech companies to flourish. Trump’s order was challenged in court and stalled. Trump made a final attempt to force Congress to repeal Section 230 by vetoing the National Defense Authorisation Act (NDAA), the annual defence funding bill. But in an extraordinary New Year’s Day session (2021), the Republican controlled Senate, an otherwise loyal and even subservient branch that has enabled virtually all Trump’s shenanigans and twice shielded and protected him from removal from office, easily overrode the veto, dismissing Trump’s objections to the $740 billion spending bill and handed him a stinging rebuke just weeks before he vacated the White House – the very first veto override in his presidency.
Long before that, Trump also attempted to ban or block new downloads of Chinese-owned short video-sharing app WeChat and TikTok, over national security concerns but, in reality, because users of the apps conspired to embarrass him and scuttled his grand rally at the height of the Coronavirus Pandemic in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Trump issued executive orders that were immediately blocked by the courts and recently withdrawn by the Biden administration.  
Before the crackdown, Twitter has been Trump’s most potent weapon against his opponents, news outlets and those who criticise him. He used it to devastating effect, sending out early morning and late-evening posts in flurries. In fact, he owes his rise to the presidency to Twitter and Facebook. In an interview in Fox Business in 2017, Trump acknowledged that fact and was effusive with his praise for Twitter and Facebook. “I doubt I would be here if it weren’t for social media, to be honest with you.”   Even amidst demands by leaders of the Republican party for him to rein in his Twitter usage, he said Twitter is a “tremendous platform” that allows him to bypass unfair media coverage and speak directly to voters and his supporters. “Twitter is like a typewriter – when I put it out, you put it immediately on your show”, he told the host on Fox Business network. “When somebody says something about me, I am able to go bing, bing, bing and I take care of it. The other way, I would never get the word out”. Many American politicians, policy experts, diplomats and administrators lived in constant fear of Trump’s twitter rants, not knowing what American long held policies, principles, alliance or practices was going to be under attack or jeopardised by Trump’s twitter rank. A good example was when American diplomats were in Qatar negotiating with the Taliban on America’s conditions for withdrawal from Afghanistan. Trump went on Twitter to announce American withdrawal from Afghanistan, undercutting the negotiators and strengthening the hands of the Taliban.
When Twitter eventually banned him and with his failure to abrogate Section 230, he promised to launch his own social media network. In May 2021, he launched his platform: “From the Desk of Donald J. Trump”. It was configured like Twitter but hosted a running blog of commentary. Less than a month later, it was shut down permanently due to low patronage. He’s still struggling to find a popular social media platform to use.
What joy it would have been then for Trump that Buhari was able to do what he couldn’t do. Within just two days of Twitter deleting his tweet, Buhari has ordered the shutdown of Twitter in Nigeria, got all internet providers to remove the app from their holdings and threatened citizens who still use the site with prosecution. Trump was euphoric! He even called on more countries to ban Twitter and Facebook for not allowing free and open speech. And as usual, he went on to lie that “perhaps, I should have done it while I was president. But Zukerberg kept calling me and coming to the White House for dinner telling me how great I was.”
Obviously, Trump cannot unilaterally ban Twitter and other social media. He tried it but his attempts all failed because America has strong institutions that operate seamlessly in spite of any one person in power. We also know Trump’s love for and constant adulation of autocrats. He is congratulating Buhari for destroying his country’s institutions. He’s congratulating Buhari for turning throwing hundreds of thousands of Nigerians who depend on twitter for their businesses into joblessness and hopelessness in a country with the second highest unemployment rate in the world because his ego was bruised. He’s congratulating Buhari for sending notice to foreign investors that Nigeria is not a country where one can invest in because one’s investment can just disappear at the whim of an individual.
In many ways, Trump and Buhari are alike. The only difference between them is that they operated in different environments. While Trump operated under a setting with many institutions of restraint, Buhari operates in a setting with no institutions to check him. That is why he keeps destroying every fabric of the country.
6/17/21, 15:31 - +234 802 474 1100: Oga Chris o! 

I waka pass😀🏃🏾
6/17/21, 15:31 - +234 802 474 1100: Lemme drop this one 

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/17/supreme-court-sides-with-catholic-adoption-agency-that-refuses-to-work-with-lgbt-couples.html?__source=iosappshare%7Cnet.whatsapp.WhatsApp.ShareExtension
6/17/21, 15:34 - +234 802 474 1100: What is wrong with us « progressives » ..... so someone went to court to try and force a catholic adoption agency to go against its own values in order for LBGTQ couples to adopt.....

With all the other non catholic adoption agencies available.... the couple get time to go sue the agency... Sometimes conservatives in the US have a point
6/17/21, 15:35 - +234 802 971 7134: It’s a free country
6/17/21, 15:36 - +234 802 474 1100: How do you mean?
6/17/21, 15:37 - +234 802 971 7134: There are laws against discrimination. So if anyone perceives they are being discriminated against they can sue
6/17/21, 15:37 - +234 802 971 7134: And the Supreme Court is siding because of its setup
6/17/21, 15:37 - +234 802 971 7134: I’m not saying it’s right or wrong o
6/17/21, 15:37 - +234 802 971 7134: Just saying
6/17/21, 15:39 - +234 802 474 1100: Me I side with the Supreme Court o... Not because it is right or wrong.... but because i find it ridiculous to fight for your freedom by trying to force another person/group to give up his...

Kinda like the baker that refused to make a cake for an LGBTQ wedding
6/17/21, 15:40 - +234 802 971 7134: Oh well
6/17/21, 15:40 - +234 802 971 7134: This is America
6/17/21, 15:40 - +234 802 474 1100: If a KKK run adoption agency refused to give a white baby to a black couple. I wouldn’t sue. They said what their goal is in their name.... advertised it even
6/17/21, 15:41 - +234 802 971 7134: So why was there a fight for equality when they had white only bars or restaurants?
6/17/21, 15:41 - +234 802 971 7134: It was advertised too
6/17/21, 15:42 - +234 802 971 7134: Why did black people feel like they belonged in there too?
6/17/21, 15:45 - Dee: First of all, I am not a religious person. Not even close. So this is not because I am a Christian or anything. 

But the LGBTQ community's fight can be ironic sometimes. 

It is nobody's business who other people have sex with agreed, but I don't have to like it. I have no rights whatsoever to stop you but I don't have to like it. What I like or not like is my right. 

So if my religion says that it is not allowed, and it has always been like that before your community became so popular, then, with your right not to like it, just form a different group and people will support and defend that. 

But when u claim the whole world should change their belief system, jst to make yuo happy, are you not the ones taking away their freedoms?
6/17/21, 15:46 - +234 802 474 1100: You have a point  there sha
6/17/21, 15:47 - +234 802 474 1100: Exactly
6/17/21, 15:48 - +234 802 971 7134: Is Christianity United on LGBT? You have churches that do don’t ask don’t tell. You have churches that openly welcome them. You have churches that despise them and you have churches that ordain them. They are not forcing you to like them. They are just saying we want to enjoy all the niceties you enjoy.
6/17/21, 15:49 - +234 802 971 7134: Like raising a family and all. Yea it’s not the natural way but many traditional couples conceive through means that were impossible many years ago eg IVF or surrogacy
6/17/21, 15:50 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Which is why there are adoption agencies that support lgbtq families, they don’t have to use a Catholic one
6/17/21, 15:51 - Kenneth Maths. US.: When the Catholic Church even "welcome" them in the first place, why will they not want to have right to adopt or sue the Church
6/17/21, 15:51 - +234 802 971 7134: Are the adoption agencies that are open to LGBT closed to traditional couples?
6/17/21, 15:52 - +234 802 971 7134: Are there no Catholic LGBT folks? Abi the priests wey the kolobi boys Wetin dem be?
6/17/21, 15:52 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Their value system is all encompassing
6/17/21, 15:53 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Dey are living in hiding
6/17/21, 15:53 - +234 802 971 7134: The church cannot take the high moral ground on this one I’m sorry
6/17/21, 15:53 - +234 802 971 7134: Open hiding be that
6/17/21, 15:56 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: But if I cannot sue Mcdonalds for not serving me a Whopper, why should I sue a church that I know is against same sex couples for not allowing me be a same sex couple, they didn’t force me to come, na me carry leg go o. It’s not like they are the only option either o.
6/17/21, 15:56 - Dee: Not even sure Christianity these days is united on anything. I am saying it from human point of view. 

So every living human should have access to the same rights as any other human in the world as stated by the law of the land. 

But if I don't like the smell of okro soup and you like okro soup then I can say, I understand your right to eat okro soup. So let me go build this new house and say cooking okro soup is not allowed here. 

Doesn't mean I can't come visit you and you can cook okro in your house. Doesnt mean we can't work together, party together,  pray together, do whatever together. 

But when u then say, no o, that house I built is where u come to come visit and I must allow u to cook okro soup, I don't think that is fair. 

I should have a safe space where I can practice what I believe and you should have a safe space where you can practice what you belive
6/17/21, 15:56 - Dee: *Believe
6/17/21, 15:57 - +234 802 971 7134: McDonalds didn’t deny you a burger cos you claim you’re vegan
6/17/21, 15:57 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Deji e be like say we too like food😁
6/17/21, 15:57 - +234 802 971 7134: They even offer you vegan options
6/17/21, 15:58 - +234 802 971 7134: That’s a personal okro house. Not an okro enterprise
6/17/21, 15:59 - Dee: 😀
6/17/21, 16:02 - Dee: Yeah true. I was trying to simplify it to sth we can easily see.
6/17/21, 16:07 - Dee: So religion worldwide is based on certain values and laws. Written down long long time ago. Agreed some of it don't make a lot of sense but it is what it is. 

As a Christian, I can preach to Muslims that Jesus is the only way. As a Muslim, I can preach to Christians that Mohammed is the only way. As an atheist, I can tell both of them to wake up and stop believing in fairy tales. But one cannot force the other to accept their own belief. 

Please don't get me wrong, I don't hate the LGBTQ community. True I may find men kissing men kinda disgusting but I am totally for ladies kissing eachother and doing other things. 😁😁. 

I just think the community can pick the battles they fight with a bit more fairness.
6/17/21, 16:08 - +234 802 971 7134: I agree with the ladies part. I think we are in a world where it’s live and let’s live. We’d just learn to co-exist
6/17/21, 16:10 - Dee: Exactly. If we only treat others how we ourselves would like to be treated, we won't have a problem.

Don't worry, once we tick off all the items on the bucket list, no more detours. Staying firmly on the narrow path

6/17/21, 17:04 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Its important to take the detour and at least know what happens on the other side. 
So that when you preach and ask people to stay on the narrow path you would be speaking form a place of knowledge...


Its all to boost the ministry 😁
6/17/21, 17:05 - Dee: For where? They cannot find anything out i promise you. Some of those apps carry normal looking names.  Some apps don't even show up on your phone home page. U are very safe to fully experience your detour

Boya Smart is in Australia laidis sef 😂
6/20/21, 16:00 - +234 803 072 5702: Article 19 of the UN Human Rights declaration 😂…daddy GO is my mentor😁
6/20/21, 16:08 - +234 803 075 0650: They didn't plan this their ban well. The moment those religious people began violating it I knew the government can't do nothing. Their madness never reach that level yet🤪
6/20/21, 16:09 - +234 803 075 0650: That is what haste and irrational anger make you do.
6/20/21, 16:37 - +234 803 072 5702: As in…that Adeboye and Kumuyi tweet probably saved many of us😁
6/20/21, 16:45 - +234 803 075 0650: I was waiting for Adesina to insult his General Superintendent or Garba Shehu to insult Adeboye. Even those ones know that's a no-go area
6/20/21, 16:58 - Dee: Just asking o. What makes Adeboye and Kumayi no go areas?
6/20/21, 17:00 - +234 803 075 0650: The war they have been toying with will finally meet them. They know it.  Nigerians that are religious fanatics already
6/20/21, 17:01 - +234 803 075 0650: You can so anything to Nigerians. They'll bear. But touch their men of God and you'll know they can fight back
6/20/21, 17:04 - Dee: Ha I get now. So it's not the men themselves the government is afraid of, but the fanatical devotion  of a lot of Nigerian worshipers to their "Men of God"
6/20/21, 17:18 - +234 803 075 0650: It's like a boss flirting with the wife this subordinate. That's when he'll realise he doesn't really have the kind of power he thought he had over his subordinate
6/20/21, 17:18 - Dee: 😀
6/20/21, 17:20 - Dee: Maybe if we subject the church leaders to the same laws of the land and actually prosecute  anyone of them that breaks it, we won't have so many fanatical followers
6/20/21, 17:36 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): This one you have talk now is a whole case study. In fact, we may need to create a full department in an institution of learning to fully address this statement
6/20/21, 17:37 - Dee: Ha tor.
6/20/21, 17:37 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): At the intersection of religious studies, political science, psychology, theology, sociology...in fact, all the Ologies + law join
6/20/21, 17:39 - Dee: 😀
6/20/21, 17:45 - +234 803 075 0650: If na that one, your church is most guilty o. We give the 'men of God' so much powers and say they're not accountable to us or to any man but God. That's what's exacerbating the bad behavior. 
Someone recently posted how priests have the most difficult job in the world and how we need to pray for them because they're always under the attack of the devil. I simply asked how about accountability and I was accused of heresy
6/20/21, 17:47 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Akon, but I didn't say the Catholic church was exampt na 😄
6/20/21, 17:48 - +234 803 075 0650: So the fight should start from home. The abuse they perpetrate is unsustainable really
6/20/21, 17:49 - +234 803 075 0650: *let me add 'some of them' o before you people descend on me 🤭
6/20/21, 17:50 - Dee: Hmm, the way people in general attack you when u even remotely suggest that Men of God are just men and make mistakes like men and all, that is scary. 

Like very intelligent people could be discussing intelligently about questioning everything, demanding proof and being logical. But once u introduce religion and men of God, foam. Brian out of the window
6/20/21, 17:50 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): There is a problem of religious fanatism in Nigeria. More often than not, common sense flies out of the door when religion or men of God comes up. This happens regardless of Christianity or Islam, protestant or Catholic
6/20/21, 17:50 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Personally, I don't think the root cause of the problem is the men of God. The root cause of the problem is the people that empower them and hold them above the law
6/20/21, 17:53 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Now, how do you hold men of God accountable and who will hold men of God accountable? It is a society problem. It is not a denomination problem. And until society (Nigeria) in this case comes to the understanding that all me and people within a geographic region must abide by the laws of the land - no exceptions - and there are laws, courts, systems in place to ensure that this is actionable, we are not solving the problem
6/20/21, 17:54 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): And so I refer back to my earlier statement: this is a case study
6/20/21, 17:54 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): *all institutions and people within a geographic region...
6/20/21, 17:55 - Dee: In all my years in the world, the only person that has ever swindled some money out of me, was a strong church member. Every single men of God I have known personally (2 pastors, 4 priests and 1 imam)  have all done things that surprised the devil himself. Which i found out later on. In my own experience, the so called bad people are the ones that have proven to the truthsworthy. 

People will  blame an engineer when a building or bridge falls. People will blame a doctor when he messes up a surgery. People will blame a pilot for flying rubbish. 

But when a man of God messes up and u even try to explain to people that he should be called out and punished, you start to hear rubbish
6/20/21, 17:56 - Dee: Very very true
6/20/21, 18:07 - +234 803 075 0650: In the case if the catholic, it's not culture. It's rooted in the institution itself. We can trace the problem of non-accountability to the development of the priesthood itself. And various societies have to force accountability on priests themselves. France guillotined many priests with the royalty during the French revolution. Spain during the civil war of 1950s. Western Europe and American are now seizing the sexual abuse scandal of children to force accountability. It's only in Africa and Asia that nothing has been done. And this maybe because of the relative newness of Catholicism in these places. But the abuses can't continue forever.
6/20/21, 18:26 - Dee: If i am being honest, present day non catholic men of God have taken over. What they do these days has gone beyond what the catholic priests do. 

Now I am not saying the catholic priests are any better or worse. Just saying that these new generation churches and their members, take the phrase "touch not my anointed" to a while new level. 

They are the ones that will bless you based on how much you contribute to a project. 

They r d ones that will tell u to eat grass as saidth by the Lord. Its endless. 

Whichever way, catholic or not, we should be able to hold our men of God accountable the same way we hold other people accountable not making excuses for them
6/20/21, 18:28 - +234 803 075 0650: It's because they claim to hear from God directly on almost everything.  Can you dare disobey God?
6/20/21, 18:42 - Dee: So I gotta ask. If I am a child of God. And they are children of God. And God loves me as he loves them, and God knows my house address as he knows their house address, why isn't God taking to me directly? 

Because anyone can claim God told him to do sth. 

One guy @ dominos pizza saw me going upstairs to get milkshake for my kids. He approached me and showed me the receipt In his hands. 

As I saw him coming towards me with receipt in his hands, I knew he needed help with money. Just didn't know what for. 

I already had my hand on in my back pocket when he said, he just came from redeem camp to buy Pizza. He is a man of God and he has finished the cash with him. He then said as he saw me, the lord told him to approach me that I will pay for his cold stone ice cream. I had to ask him again to be sure I heard correctly. 

He repeated it with so much confidence, I was taken aback for a second. So, of all the problems of people in the world at time, it is your ice-cream the Lord is worried about?

My hand came out of my back pocket lighting quick. I told him immediately, the Lord lied to you bro. 

The weirdest part was he looked super shocked. He couldn't understand why I will not pay for his ice-cream when he said the lord told him to ask me. 

I realised immediately how far gone a lot of us were with worshipping. If he truly  expected that would get him his icecream.
6/20/21, 18:47 - +234 803 075 0650: You're not hearing from God directly because you're not in tune with his spirit. They teach now to connect to the divine wavelength and hear directly from God. As Bishop Oyedepo would say, "faith without divine revelation always will wither away". It is hearing from God that sustains their faith. You need to listen to their preaching. You can never understand them if you don't listen to them.
6/20/21, 18:54 - +234 803 075 0650: Their logic is perfect I must admit.  They argue God is the same yesterday, today and forever. He never changes. So if He spoke directly to the prophets of old, he still speaks directly to the prophets and pastors of today. Simple!!!!
6/20/21, 18:55 - Dee: So if they can hear the divine wavelength, and we run the same biology, what stops me from hearing the same wavelength?
6/20/21, 18:58 - +234 803 075 0650: You're not tuned in
6/20/21, 18:58 - Dee: This is the problem right here. The prophets of today. The things some of them do these days surprises the devil himself.  
And they all claim the lord told them to do so. 

So how do we separate the divine wavelength of indaboski  from the divine wavelength of Adeboye? See where i am going with that? How do we know one is true while the other is rubbish?
6/20/21, 18:59 - +234 803 075 0650: That's you problem. They'll quote 1st John for you. Test all spirits🤪
6/20/21, 19:00 - Dee: 😀 omo, I have tested many spirits. And they have all failed woefully
6/20/21, 19:01 - +234 803 075 0650: You're employing the wrong testing instruments then🤪
6/20/21, 19:04 - Dee: 😀 ok o
6/20/21, 19:07 - +234 803 075 0650: I was intrigued by the level of fanaticism and loyalty these people hold to their men of God that I was forced to start listening to them live to understand why. I tell you if I were in their congregation, I wouldn't turn out differently. Their logic is iron cast. 99.9 percent of their congregation cannot detect the fallacies in their logic or assumptions
6/20/21, 19:15 - Dee: Honestly, my life is very simple. I live by very simple rules. 

1. Family first above everything else. 
2. Do not do to others what you wouldn't want others to do to you. 
3. I will do whatever i want, whenever i want, wherever I want, however I want. As long as it isn't against the law of the country i live in and it doesn't bring harm to anyone physically or emotionally.
4. Practise what you preach. This number 4 right here is the problem. It is what has messed up my religious life. because  I hold everyone else to same standards. 

So if I see a man of God saying one thing on the pulpit and doing something else on the low,  I can't take such  a person and his entire message seriously
6/20/21, 19:16 - Dee: Mehn i will question the shit out of the man if I spend some time with him alone.
6/20/21, 19:21 - +234 803 075 0650: Carnal principles 😛
6/20/21, 19:21 - +234 803 075 0650: No wonder you don't hear directly from God🤣🤣🤣
6/20/21, 19:22 - Dee: 😀😀
6/20/21, 20:13 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): 🤣🤣🤣
6/20/21, 20:17 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): More like people have given over their agency to the supposed logic of the pastor. Bcos, where in the bible did God make this particular man of God the frequency police and bouncer? Is it not one day he woke up and decided the voice he was hearing on whatever frequency was the voice of God?
6/20/21, 20:17 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Poverty and desperation join sha. All of us dey find answers one way or the other
6/20/21, 20:19 - Dee: Exactly

Portugal Training Session and Press Conference - UEFA Euro 2020: Group F
BUDAPEST, HUNGARY - JUNE 14: Cristiano Ronaldo of[+]UEFA VIA GETTY IMAGES
More From Forbes
Before Portugal’s Euro 2020 football championship opener, Cristiano Ronaldo was preparing for a pre-match press conference. Two minutes before it began, the Juventus megastar forward put aside the two Coca-Cola bottles placed in front of him and said “agua” (water) while smiling to the journalists.

The reaction to this playful gesture, which included a slew of news articles saying that Ronaldo’s actions were responsible for wiping $4 billion off of Coca-Cola’s market value, has come to illustrate a grave problem.

A post-truth world
In 2016, the Oxford English Dictionary’s Word of the Year was “post-truth.” Post-truth is defined as “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief”. The phrase gained prominence during the Trump presidency and the UK’s Brexit referendum. But there is a deluge of unsupported claims made every day by people whose prominence helps shape public policy and opinion. Over the past year of the pandemic, for instance, we have all listened to people without any medical qualifications expound on the health crisis. Unfortunately, their comments frequently influenced decision-making.

In the current (social) media landscape, truth can be deliberately manipulated, and disinformation is a growing business. Importantly, we, the readers of information, are naturally programmed to accept ‘evidence’ that supports our pre-existing views (i.e. confirmation bias) and disregard opposing arguments.

This phenomenon affects individuals and businesses. And it has the potential to undermine democracy.

Misleading headlines
Given his global superstar status and vast social media reach, Cristiano Ronaldo’s actions moving the Coca-Cola bottles are likely to have implications.

However, a few hours after the Euro 2020 opener, a rash of articles had appeared all over the world suggesting that Ronaldo’s distaste for unhealthy Coca-Cola products had wiped out $4 billion of the brand’s value.

A slew of business publications echoed the thought. Many quoted the Spanish newspaper Marca, which had “analyzed the [Coca-Cola] data from the New York Stock Exchange.” Other outlets simply repeated the message without citations: Some commentators concluded that one man, from a relatively small country, could sink a US multinational. Others praised the taste-making power of influencers, and argued that more companies should elevate them in their marketing plans.

Yet so much of this conjecture was built on a shaky, if not false, premise

The incident reveals the importance of critical thinking for business leaders, and the reading public, especially now.  

What else moves share prices?
It is true that Ronaldo, in front of the press, declined to drink the strategically-placed Coca-Colas on offer. It is also true that, by the time the press conference was over, Coca-Cola’s value was down $4 billion. However, there were other factors affecting the beverage giant’s stock price.

Some non-alternative facts:

Coca-Cola has 4.3 billion shares, and closed on Friday, June 11, with a share price of $56.16 for a market value of $242 billion.
On Monday, June 14, Coca-Cola opened lower, at 9:30 a.m. EST.
At 9:40 a.m. EST, its stock price was $55.26 (down 1.6%) and the market value had dipped to $238 billion, $4 billion lower than the prior day.
Cristiano Ronaldo moves the Coca-Cola bottles at 9.43 a.m. EST, and says “Água”.
It is a fact, then, that Coca-Cola’s market value was already down $4 billion by the time of Ronaldo’s snub. Instead, various factors which have nothing to do with CR7 explain the drop.

For instance, at 9.40 a.m. EST, the whole US stock market was trading low. Ford Motor Company was down more than $2 billion in market value.

Stock movements are often too complex to attribute to a single factor. Rather, they are vulnerable to “confounding events” that happen concurrently and whose relationship to each other is blurry.  

Another fact: On June 14, Coca-Cola shares became ex-dividend. This technical term is easy to understand. When you own company shares, you receive dividends on certain days. In Coca-Cola’s case, this date was announced more than a year in advance. Once Coca-Cola became ex-dividend, that dividend had already been distributed. Of course, on the day that stocks cease to carry dividend rights, share prices adjust mechanically to a lower number. In this case, the ex-dividend date happened to coincide with Ronaldo’s conference call.

A final fact. From the moment CR7 moved the bottles (9.43 a.m. EST), until the end of the Wall Street trading day, Coca-Cola’s share price went up $0.30, adding $1.3 billion in valuation to the company.

Why should we care?
Why should we care about the post-truth issue? Because the topic obviously extends well beyond sports and stock markets and can have severe, widespread consequences beyond a dented stock portfolio. Fake news, and cherry-picked information, can arise from simple mistakes made by inexperienced individuals. They can also be sophisticated and deliberate in their attempts to mislead. Lies spread rapidly, especially on social media, and can potentially deceive voters and business leaders, as well as being used to justify government policies. There is a clear danger to individuals, companies, societies, and even democracies

What can we do?
The first step is to recognize that we have these biases. Then we must understand how these biases affect how we view news. Finally, there are methodological steps one can take, to make sure we do not fall into these traps. To start, understand we live in a post-truth world. Do not accept a fact as data. Sometimes, even large-scale data is not enough, because there are issues regarding the quality of the data.

Storytelling is an important tool. And a lively story tends to make an argument more vivid. Still, we must be aware of the dangers of accepting a single story as hard evidence.

One party arguing fathers are better than mothers and the other arguing against. The most believable is he who tells the better story - it still doesn’t make either story the TRUTH!

6/22/21, 14:18 - +234 802 474 1100: At this point I honestly don’t know which is better. I like economics but can’t claim to be an expert.

But one thing is clear, we have tried the pegged rates for a few years because of the fear of what a flexible rate would do to inflation in the short term.... and unfortunately that action has been unable to manage inflation. So it may be time to let that inflation goal go for now and focus on growth and GDP. 

Inflation would certainly rise in the short term but hey we are already at what, almost 20% inflation y o y
6/22/21, 14:26 - +234 803 075 0650: I quoted one of your teachers (was he?) in 2015. It's still true today.

"Doyin Salami of the Lagos Business School and a member of the CBN’s monetary policy committee (MPC) faulted the apex bank’s action arguing that sooner or later, the naira will be devalued to reflect its true value in the market. For him, the apex bank cannot maintain a fixed exchange rate, independent monetary policy and free movement of capital at the same time.   “You’re allowed to choose two out of the three,” he argued.  “The key question is which two will Nigeria choose? That will have to be answered in the coming months. I would rather Nigeria maintain independent monetary policy and have a market-determined exchange rate.”
6/22/21, 14:41 - +234 802 474 1100: 👍 True , still applies

But even he left that door open on which 2 of three to choose, because like most great economists, they are humble enough to note that there are no slam dunk solutions. 

But absolutely it’s time to abandon what has not worked, clearly for the past 6yrs and move to a flexible rate especially now when we have little else to lose with regards to inflation

6/24/21, 06:11 - +234 803 075 0650: Abiy Ahmed: From a Nobel Peace laureate to a war monger
Christopher Akor
In 2019, Abiy Ahmed, the Ethiopian Prime Minister was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to reform and democratise Ethiopia and for making peace with neighbouring Eritrea by ending a long-running border war. Ahmed came to power in 2018 on the heels of protests and demand for inclusion and instantly set about dismantling the over 30 years authoritarian rule of the four-party alliance Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), whose senior and dominant partner was the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). He promptly released all political prisoners, allowed all the exiled to return home, opened up the democratic space, initiated major economic reforms and also did the unthinkable – signed a peace deal with Ethiopia’s biggest foe, Eritrea, almost immediately, ending decades border standoff.
 The world was literally wowed by the speed of the earth-shaking reforms being undertaken by this young and dynamic leader in Africa and the Norwegian Nobel Committee promptly awarded him the Nobel Peace Prize in December 2019 in recognition of “his decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighbouring Eritrea,” resulting in a peace deal they hope “will help to bring about positive change for the entire populations of Ethiopia and Eritrea.”
However, less than a year after, Ahmed is leading a military campaign against the Tigray region that has killed thousands and displaced millions more with credible accusations of ethnic cleansing and war crimes being levelled against the Ethiopian and Eritrean troops. How did it all go wrong for Ahmed in such a short time? Was the peace deal with Eritrea a ruse after all?
There were many Ethiopians and Eritreans who think instead of a Nobel Peace Prize, Abiy Ahmed and the Eritrean dictator Isaias Afwerki should have received an Oscar for their performances. Critics have argued that what was advertised as a peace deal was rather an opportunistic realignment of forces against a common foe – Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). The Nobel Committee was ignorant of or chose to ignore the internal politics of Ethiopia or even the dynamics of the conflict between the two warring countries and took Abiy’s peace initiatives at face value.
What was known as the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict was mainly between the TPLF and the Eritrean dictator, Afwerki. After Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, a failure to demarcate the border led to a deadly two-year war from 1998 to 2000 that left over 80, 000 dead on both sides.
Although a peace deal was agreed between the two parties in 2000 that ended hostilities, the deal was not honoured by the TPLF and the border dispute remained unresolved, resulting in a state of “no-peace-no-war” between the two sides. Consequently, diplomatic relations were severed, borders closed and air travel halted between the neighbours.
 Of course, Ethiopia lost access to the sea but also succeeded in isolating Eritrea diplomatically. Afwerki used that opportunity to consolidate his power, unleashing a reign of terror on opponents and dissenters, shut down free press and used the excuse of being in a state of war to conscript most young people to indefinite period of national service in the military.
To undermine the rule of the TPLF, Afwerki decided on a policy of support for Ethiopian opposition groups especially with the Oromos, the largest ethno-linguistic group of about 35 million people, constituting more than one-third of the population.
The TPLF that had been in charge of Ethiopia since 1991 badly miscalculated when, in 2018, at the height of anti-government protests in several parts of the country, made a significant concession by choosing Abiy Ahmed of the Oromo Democratic Party, one of the junior partners in the EPRDF Coalition, as Prime Minister. The TPLF saw Ahmed, then in his early 40s, had served in the military, was an intelligence officer, and rose through the ranks in the ruling government, as a relatively safe pair of hands whose appointment would not only pacify the protesters, but, in the words of Declan Walsh of the New York Times, “would guarantee the continuation of the same system of rule and guarantee the interests of the Tigrayan political elite.”
No sooner had Ahmed taken power than he began to dismantle the hold of the TPLF on power and to build powerful coalitions against it. That explains the lightning speed with which peace with Eritrea was reached. Of course, beyond the financial and international benefits for both Abi and Afwerki, the two came together essentially, according to Vanessa Tsehaye, a Swedish-Eritrean activist, “under the guise of peace to isolate the TPLF....The TPLF and Eritrean government remain enemies... There is still no peace between the groups who initiated the original border conflict.” Tsehaye branded the peace deal, in an opinion piece for CNN on December 10 2019, as “political opportunism.”
But as the world was celebrating Ahmed, his decision to open the democratic space back at home opened the floodgates and previously suppressed ethnic tensions came bursting out and flowing over.  Abiy struggled to contain the protests for regional autonomy and soon after reverted to the old play book. He began locking up political opponents, curtailing the freedom of the press and unleashing brutality against protesters. From a young, liberal and dynamic leader, Abiy quickly moved back to the authoritarianism that he was supposed to have replaced. What is more, he was setting the stage for a brutal confrontation with his erstwhile benefactors – the Tigrayan ruling elite – by marginalising them from power and prosecuting some of them for human right abuses, corruption and other sundry crimes.
Matters came to a head in March when Abiy postponed the much anticipated August 2020 general elections for 10 months over covid-19. The TPLF ignored him and went ahead with the elections in its region, winning by a landslide and setting it on a collision course with the federal government.
On November 4, while the world was focused on the US elections, Abiy claimed the TPLF attacked a northern military command post and ordered federal forces into Tigray.  His new buddy, Isaias Afwerki, also sent in troops to assist in neutralising the TPLF. To control the flow of information, the Ethiopian government effectively locked down the Tigray region, imposing communications and internet blackout of the region, and preventing aid agencies, medics and journalists from entering the region.
After more than six months of fighting, reports from the region are harrowing: thousands have died, most of the region’s 5.5 million people urgently need humanitarian aid, and more than 2 million are displaced. Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers are accused of targeting and massacring civilians, extrajudicial killings, widespread looting and rape. What is more, they are also accused of blocking food aid and stopping farmers from harvesting, ploughing, or planting, and killing livestock and looting farm equipment. Tigray is on the brink of famine, a crisis that several diplomats have described as “manmade.”
As a final slap on the face of Ethiopians, the twice postponed polls held on Monday with the exception of Tigray and other places deemed unsafe amid widespread calls for boycotts.
Maybe next time, the international community, especially the Nobel committee shouldn’t be too fast in canonising leaders. They should wait until they are safely out of office.

6/26/21, 08:56 - Benedict: Fintechs are part of the banking sector? Fintechs that banks, led by the CBN are trying so hard to frustrate out  of business?
6/26/21, 09:00 - +234 802 474 1100: 😀😀

They are part of the banking sector. I stand corrected if there’s a better classification.

And yes, our CBN, we all agree have not been very welcoming of things they do not understand. 

On the other hand, that’s kinda the job of regulators e.g various global banks being sceptical of blockchain and trying to regulate it. Risk vs Return.
6/26/21, 09:01 - +234 802 474 1100: It’s competition too... That’s good for increasing our banked population
6/26/21, 09:46 - Benedict: The better classification is Technology sector 😁
6/26/21, 09:46 - Benedict: Paystack that is mentioned in the article doesnt even provide banking services
6/26/21, 09:48 - Benedict: they only provide technology that enhances transactions
6/26/21, 09:48 - Benedict: This same technology can be applied by paystack or some other firm into the health sector or some other sector
6/26/21, 09:49 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Pls which technology can be applied to government sector so that they will be having sense?

6/26/21, 09:52 - +234 802 474 1100: IMO
6/26/21, 09:57 - Benedict: If paystack is in the banking sector then so is Microsoft and Oracle etc
6/26/21, 09:59 - Benedict: For you to be into banking, you must provide at least one of savings or loans products naa. Payback offers neither.
6/26/21, 10:03 - Benedict: Tah. If 1 of the softwares I built is used by hospitals to manage their patients information, you will categorise me as being in the health sector abi? Despite the fact that the the same software is also used to manage customer data by a transportation company 🤷🏾‍♂️
6/26/21, 10:03 - Benedict: Technology is broad, yes. If all I provide is technology, then I'm a tech company.
6/26/21, 10:04 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Simple!
6/26/21, 10:04 - Benedict: There's no slippery slope here. I would even argue that the slippery slope is the other way round.

6/26/21, 10:06 - Benedict: If flutterwave and paystack are financial institutions then Microsoft is cos most banks use Microsoft products. And oracle is too cos most banks use oracle database 😂
6/26/21, 10:06 - Benedict: No mind Eugene.🤣🤣
6/26/21, 10:18 - +234 802 474 1100: Nah... Technology is an enabler of everything. I wouldn’t put it under a tech sector anymore.
6/26/21, 10:19 - +234 802 474 1100: Just trying to balance the view o 😀
6/26/21, 10:25 - +234 803 072 5702: Renewables are still in their infancy in Nigeria. Nigerian Breweries Ibadan launched something similar last month or so. 
The fact is that the high initial capital costs, just like for natural gas vehicles, would always be a deterrent. Life cycle is also an issue…many of these installations pack up after few years
6/26/21, 10:27 - Benedict: Okay naa. @14692437489 works in the banking sector then since Microsoft provides technology that enables the banking sector. 🤷🏾‍♂️

6/26/21, 11:00 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Agree with you that there are sectors of growth in Nigeria. What I will say is that, bcos Mckinsey does a classification a certain way does not make it THE way. Every consulting company does their classifications in different ways based on who is writing and their motivations
6/26/21, 11:01 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): It is possible to agree that fintech is growing while challenging that fintech should be classified under the banking sector, especially in Nigeria where integration has no been achieved like in Europe
6/26/21, 11:02 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): One has to read these articles bearing in mind assumptions and context
6/26/21, 11:02 - Benedict: But technology is growing "in spite of" Nigeria and her government.
6/26/21, 11:03 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): I agree with this whole-heartedly!
6/26/21, 11:03 - Benedict: Danke
6/26/21, 11:25 - +234 802 474 1100: Fully agree. But what is YOUR view on the McKinsey classification. That’s why I said the classification is besides the point. 

Benedwit while arguing that Fintech was Tech also submitted that they are being regulated by CBN. Last I checked CBN isn’t a tech regulator. 

But again, that’s a rabbit hole
6/26/21, 11:28 - Dee: 😀
6/26/21, 11:30 - +234 802 474 1100: Lol... I do think that Uber is regulated by transport unions across the world. I think that their operations is transport enabled by tech. They are a tech company leveraging technology in the transportations sector. 

Hmmmm.. but even that isn’t the point today. Like you said, you can make any set of assumptions to arrive at a classification. 

So @2348028945332 sorry, Fintech is tech sector for you. For me it’s Financial services aka Banking. 😀🤷‍♀️
6/26/21, 11:38 - Dee: From this voice note now, is it omo that has "Japa" or Eugene that has "Pada"
6/26/21, 11:40 - +234 802 474 1100: 😂😂😂
6/26/21, 11:43 - +234 803 075 0650: @2348024741100 you make me laugh really. Who has been the single most greatest impediment to achieving financial inclusion in Nigeria? The CBN. It has refused to allow fintech companies perform retail banking services arguing that they're not banks and won't be allowed to. Nigeria has repeatedly failed to meet any goal of financial inclusion. Whereas countries like Kenya, Tanzania and Ghana have make huge progress in providing digital financial services to their people. In fact, the fintech growth you're advertising is in spite of the government and the CBN, who've done everything in their power to cripple the sector
6/26/21, 11:44 - +234 803 075 0650: Renewable energy is a no-brainer. When businesses and homes don't have electricity why won't they attempt to plug into renewable energy which is the next alternative to generators?
6/26/21, 11:45 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Na Odenigbo Pada o
6/26/21, 11:46 - +234 802 474 1100: You are mixing issues again. I have NOT advertised the CBN. By acknowledging that there are positive stories that YOU can write about to balance your Writing perspective and Branding, I am not saying that the government is doing well.

All the innovation I talk about are private sector led. Why can’t you separate the two? That I celebrate private sector led growth, does not equate to a celebration of Nigerias political leadership
6/26/21, 11:50 - +234 802 474 1100: I am simply asking you to write from a different perspective once in a while. There are things to celebrate and I think that it makes you more credible even
6/26/21, 11:50 - +234 803 075 0650: Yes. There are private sector led growth's that are all eventually frustrated by the government eventually. So writing about them is useless because we'll all return back to square one eventually.
There is something you must get. We cannot innovate our way out if bad governance. If you don't fix governance, everything you do will still be scuppered by bad governance.
6/26/21, 11:54 - Dee: 😀😀 I swear,  if we check am, one government official collect chris babe sometime in the past.
6/26/21, 11:54 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Perhaps Eugene may be happy if you write about these tech growths...and show how govt frustrates it all🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
6/26/21, 11:57 - +234 803 075 0650: I have in the past. I was involved in a Bill and Melinda Gates supported reporting on financial inclusion reporting programme. After sometime, I just refused to participate again. The reason is that the Nigerian government and the CBN is the single biggest obstacle to financial inclusion in Nigeria and I've written all I could about it. Reporting on one or two private-sector led initiatives is useless because eventually the government will frustrate them all
6/26/21, 11:58 - +234 802 474 1100: 😂😂😂😂
1-0
6/26/21, 11:59 - +234 803 075 0650: My conclusion is: we cannot innovate our way out of bad and catastrophic governance. We must fox governance if not, we'll continue dancing on one spot for ever
6/26/21, 12:08 - +234 803 075 0650: Or is it the successes of the tech industry? I've written countless articles on them some even though I was doing PR for MTN. But isn't the government supreintending the demolition of the industry now? If not that MTN had already made so much money from Nigeria and have the Nigerian market at its fingertips, it would have abandon the country too like shoprite and all other south African businesses are doing
6/26/21, 12:15 - Dee: So, I may be wrong, but  I have noticed something overtime. The problem of Nigeria is not all the fault of our current leaders. The problem of  Nigeria is mostly Nigerians. 

It is our mindset. We want a nation where law and order works. But we are too impatient to wait for traffic light. 

We buy something at a certain price to sell to fellow Nigerians at 2% interest. Inflation rises and we increase our price to take advantage of the 200% interest. Then blame government and or dollar rise for same product. 

We complain you can't get anything done without paying bribes in this country. But you tell that young lady looking for job in your office to face down, ass up on your office table before she can get the job.  

We unleash our inner dragons when it is time to analyze on Twitter. But when it is time to come out and protest, like Hong Kong did, we turn Moana chicken. 

We complain the government is not fixing the road, not giving electricity, etc. But you use a rented house like men use socks. Toilet handle don break, no problem open the top and pull the cable. Oga cable don break, no problem, attach rubber band. Why? Because it not your house. The road that leads to the front of your company building, have u fixed it? Even if it just for yourself?

We tell landlord we don't have money to pay rent and beg for a little more time, but we are secretly building our own house. Cheating the owner of his house of his profit. 


It is hard to change the mindset of Nigerians. We lack ownership mentality. We lack maintenence culture. We lack honestly. And as such, whoever you put on that seat, will do the same thing. Find the easiest way out. Sort out family and friends. Spend/acquire without permission money that you can't even finish spending in your life time. 

We Nigerians are the problem of Nigeria
6/26/21, 12:18 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: I agree with this piece and it saddens me everyday when I think about it
6/26/21, 12:23 - +234 803 075 0650: That is the structures or institutions that are not working. Societal progress is not left for individuals. It is the failure if institutions that has led to these. Fix institutions and all these will be taken care of. Sadly, Buhari's Nigeria is a master at destroying institutions. That's why there will never be progress in Nigeria until we realise that institutions are essential for building a sustainable society
6/26/21, 12:23 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Sad but true
6/26/21, 12:31 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Eugene oh, I don't have express my self or discuss points in the way you expect them to come across. I may choose not to comment on the McKinsey article as a whole but express the view that categorising fintech in the banking sector in Nigeria is far fetched
6/26/21, 12:32 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): If we try yo read to understand + ask questions where need clarification + drink water / chilled zobo once in a while, we can all learn from different points of view and distinguish fact from opinion
6/26/21, 12:32 - Benedict: Me thinks there is an element if this but this can be easily corrected with a good policing and justice system which comes back to the government.
6/26/21, 12:33 - Benedict: If I live in a country where everyone breaks traffic laws, there is zero insensitive to obey one when I get there. In fact, I can argue that it becomes dangerous to obey one.
6/26/21, 12:34 - Benedict: If people were punished for disobeying traffic laws, others will comply
6/26/21, 12:36 - Benedict: As long as people too many people go scot-free for disobeying laws, it becomes disadvantageous to obey said laws.
6/26/21, 12:36 - +234 803 075 0650: That is institutions!!!!!!!
6/26/21, 12:36 - Benedict: If everyone bribes to get a job, na me wan come suffer because I be good boy?
6/26/21, 12:36 - Benedict: 💯
6/26/21, 12:37 - Benedict: I remember being on the express with @14692437489 in Florida.
6/26/21, 12:37 - Dee: Hmmm, this may not be entirely true. Let me use a simple example. 

Say you own a company and one of your workers is your cousin. Let us say you being the leader allows your cousin to do whatever he wants. So he comes to work late. Doesnt complete projects on time, etc. But you don't say anything. Cos he is your cousin. 

If your other workers decide to gossip vehemently about it when they are out of office but keep quiet during office hours, your cousin will continue being tardy. 

But if all your workers March straight to your office to tell you your cousin has poor work ethics, and demand he be removed or reprimanded otherwise they all go on strike, you will call your cousin to one side to tell him, bros, abeg, behave for some time first. Let everything die down. 

Our leader will go as far as we Let them.
6/26/21, 12:38 - Benedict: Most cars were going beyond the speed limit but as soon as the police car was sighted, see as everybody speed reduce
6/26/21, 12:39 - Benedict: I can fire the most vocal of the workers and the rest will adjust. That's what a Naija leader will do.
6/26/21, 12:40 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): This may be a chicken and egg situation, especially because our leaders are Nigerian first before being leaders. So the attitude of Nigerians is the attitude of their leaders
6/26/21, 12:40 - +234 803 075 0650: This is a circular argument and it has been taking care of in academic literature of structure and agency. Structure (institutions) shape human behavior.  Agency is good but can only take you so far. All societies that have developed have strong institutions
6/26/21, 12:41 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): I will say though that the balance of power between political leadership and the Nigerian population is skewed towards leadership - like everywhere else. A few people in government that commit to setting up credible and functional institutions will do infinitely more that the same number of Nigerians
6/26/21, 12:42 - +234 803 075 0650: Yes. The system is the problem. Everything is out of joint, not just leaders. So until we deliberately change the system, we'll keep getting the same outcome all the time
6/26/21, 12:43 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): *number of average Nigerians
6/26/21, 12:43 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): 💯
6/26/21, 12:43 - Bootylicious Honeypie: How do we change the system?
Who carries out the change?
6/26/21, 12:44 - Benedict: My own is that not all Nigerians are bad. As rare as they are, there are some good ones or relatively good ones. We need to elect them as leaders so they can build institutions that will carry on  their legacy.
6/26/21, 12:44 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Perhaps we need a Nigerian who does not have the Nigerian DNA to carry out the change?
6/26/21, 12:44 - +234 802 474 1100: +1 on this! 
It’s easy to write about the government after you have chosen where your ire should go. 
How do we write as well to inspire a different Nigerian people?
6/26/21, 12:44 - +234 803 075 0650: This is a big question.  Election have consequences. Leadership is also important. The two have to align for any change to take place
6/26/21, 12:46 - Bootylicious Honeypie: How do we identify and  select these few good people now and make sure they are the only one in power so that these institutions can be built?🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
6/26/21, 12:47 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): 🤣 na where to find this rare breed oh
6/26/21, 12:47 - Bootylicious Honeypie: And are these people ready to be in government or whatever position they need to hold to create these institutions so as to bring about the change we seek?
6/26/21, 12:47 - Dee: Lol. That is exactly what I am saying. Fear of what will happen to us is what incapacitates us. 

So during the Jan 6 Capitol hill protest, even though the rioters were fed lies, they truly believed the election were rigged. 

They were ready to kill anyone that dared steal their rightful win from them. Ready to give their lives. Some did give their lives. They were not ready to take the election steal. 

If the next candidate is thinking about rigging the election, after that riot, do you think he will still do it? 

When palatives were discovered and boys entered street, didn't police make themselves scare? Who born you?

One again, our leaders can only go as far as we let them
6/26/21, 12:49 - Benedict: I don't even think they are that rare.
6/26/21, 12:50 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Erm, shebi you people know that all of us on this group (the Japa crew 😂) are within the age bracket for leadership?!
6/26/21, 12:51 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Hence my question if these rare breed if Nigerians are willing to take up positions!
6/26/21, 12:51 - Benedict: Exactly. I believe a number of us here put together would do good. But individually,  we would most likely blend with the status quo
6/26/21, 12:51 - +234 802 474 1100: Yes o! Like me!
6/26/21, 12:51 - Bootylicious Honeypie: I am assuming we all are part of the rare breed 😁😁😁😁😁
6/26/21, 12:52 - +234 802 474 1100: They aren’t! We’ve just fed our selves that narrative! There are great leaders all across Nigeria in various sectors showing examples of what Nigeria could be, within their own space
6/26/21, 12:52 - Benedict: 👍
6/26/21, 12:53 - Benedict: Thing is that a lot of them wouldn't want to soil their name in the current system
6/26/21, 12:54 - Benedict: So would rather do their thing in their small corner or japa
6/26/21, 12:54 - +234 802 474 1100: Not if we keep making politics out to be the devils work
6/26/21, 12:54 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Hmmm...so we need to find those willing to sacrifice their good name in this current govt then🤔🤔🤔
6/26/21, 12:54 - +234 803 075 0650: Currently, politics have been hijacked by the money class. Without loads of money or being sponsored by a godfather, you have little chance
6/26/21, 12:55 - Bootylicious Honeypie: See how that available rare breed number is thinning down o🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
6/26/21, 12:55 - +234 803 075 0650: No. We're all willing. It's the wherewithal that is the problem
6/26/21, 12:55 - +234 802 474 1100: I agree with this. But disagree with the wording
6/26/21, 12:56 - Bootylicious Honeypie: <Media omitted>
6/26/21, 12:56 - Benedict: Must u disagree with @2348030750650 ? 🤣🤣
6/26/21, 12:56 - +234 802 474 1100: Let me land na😂
6/26/21, 12:56 - +234 802 474 1100: For any political machine to be successful anywhere in the world... you need money!
6/26/21, 12:58 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Perhaps we can borrow a left from these agrictech companies...

Source funds from "rare breed geng" and sponsor a good person into power🤔🤔
6/26/21, 12:58 - +234 802 474 1100: Saying it has been hijacked infers that it used to be any different... my understanding though.... Sorry if that’s not what you were trying to say
6/26/21, 13:00 - +234 803 075 0650: Citizens must fund the campaign of candidates they believe in. If you allow some other people do it, the candidate is loyal to whoever funded his/her election first
6/26/21, 13:00 - +234 803 075 0650: It's that simple
6/26/21, 13:00 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Na who go drop their hard earned naija money to this cause remain. Although I must say people rallied during the endsars protest
6/26/21, 13:01 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): I even attended a meeting of diasporans across UK and US that were willing to put money and effort down for various political initiatives
6/26/21, 13:02 - +234 802 474 1100: True. But truth be told, across the world campaigns are funded by $100,000 dollars a plate dinners rather. Than 100,000 $1  contributions from the people
6/26/21, 13:03 - +234 803 075 0650: Yes, but check Biden's campaign. The donations from ordinary Americans was unprecedented. Likewise Obama's
6/26/21, 13:05 - +234 802 474 1100: Really ok I’ll check I’ve not seen the data spread... would be interesting to see...
6/26/21, 13:07 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): I believe the thing to do is try. No one knows 100% that something is going to work until it is done. And that it's not how it works in the US does not mean it would not work in Nigeria. The alternative is having the 'rich' hold the government and politics hostage
6/26/21, 13:26 - +234 802 474 1100: Not just in the US... across the world literally!
Interesting that this is one area that you don’t want to take learnings from the world. Money funds politics, various countries put in laws to limit the influence - election financing laws... and that’s something we can do (literally copy those solutions that worked with a little tweak here and there) —-

6/26/21, 13:28 - +234 802 474 1100: @2348030750650 a quick Check of that Biden’s contributors revealed this article by Bloomberg...
6/26/21, 13:38 - +234 803 075 0650: Yes. But also check the donations from ordinary Americans. I can't read the whole article. I no get money to subscribe to Blomberg abeg😏

6/26/21, 13:47 - +234 802 474 1100: Lol... I no spend money o... Na my VPN Dey sometimes gimme access .. don’t ask me how 🤷‍♀️
6/26/21, 13:48 - +234 802 474 1100: Ok... looks quite well spread..

Only problem is that sometimes these super pacs are made up of one or two families who then spread donations among family members to get around election campaign financing rules
6/26/21, 13:52 - +234 803 075 0650: That could well be true. But the picture is that ordinary Americans donated like hell to both campaigns because they know it's for their interests
6/26/21, 13:54 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): I agree that money funds politics. What I'm saying is the source that money I.e. crowd funding vs few big sponsors. I don't think there is anyone who knows about politics that will say money does not fund politics, way back to ancient times sef
6/26/21, 13:55 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): What I am saying is that, in the Nigerian context, crowd having few people sign $100,000 cheques as you say may not be as effective as millions contributing $1
6/26/21, 13:58 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Abeg, how can I get my BVN oh? Without a naija phone number
6/26/21, 14:01 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Nvm. Online account to the rescue. T for Tenks!
6/26/21, 14:03 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Btw, I just realised I have NIN (national insurance number I assume). Who knew?
Abeg make una let me know when we go begin collect welfare and such 🤧
6/26/21, 14:06 - +234 803 075 0650: National Identification Number I suppose
6/26/21, 14:08 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Na wa o. Who e epp?
6/26/21, 14:09 - +234 803 075 0650: Apparently you can't apply for and get an international passport without it again
6/26/21, 14:09 - +234 803 075 0650: So e go soon epp you🤪
6/26/21, 14:11 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Ah okay. We go sha dey do passport renewal for Iya Charlie country
6/26/21, 14:13 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Ah, I have testimony. When I did my passport renewal in 2019, I applied for 64 pages passport and paid the extra.

You won't believe that when processing finish, na 32 pages them give me. When I complained, oga say make I just take my passport commot unless I want delay. Him sha say make I go room, fill form. That they will refund the balance. I went to fill form oh, but in my mind, the money don lost
6/26/21, 14:15 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): The testimony
1. Them refund the £25 on top oh. It was after 1 or 2 months but them return am

2. With COVID lockdown and no travel, my 32 pages suppose reach me till 2024 when e go expire

Isn't God good! 🙌🏼
6/26/21, 14:17 - +234 803 075 0650: That's good to hear!
6/26/21, 14:17 - +234 802 474 1100: Nigeria! What a lovely country!! 🏃🏾🏃🏾🏃🏾🏃🏾🏃🏾🏃🏾🏃🏾
6/26/21, 14:18 - +234 803 075 0650: Correct🤪🤪🤪🤪
6/26/21, 14:18 - +234 802 474 1100: Isn’t Nigeria good? You mean
6/26/21, 14:19 - +234 803 075 0650: Maybe @14692437489 will also tell us of his miracle with the Nigerian consulate in Atlanta when he's free🤪
6/26/21, 14:20 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Well, the moral of the story is. Get your naija passport from outside naija 😂
6/26/21, 14:25 - +234 802 474 1100: 😂
6/26/21, 14:25 - +234 803 075 0650: You can't be sure yet o. Let @14692437489 come and tell us his story first
6/26/21, 14:40 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Be like the story tie wrapper
6/26/21, 14:44 - +234 803 075 0650: The layer of wrapper go surprise you. Well, na Ken story to tell sha
6/26/21, 15:45 - Dee: Never had issues getting passport in 9ja o. All my passports, except my very first one, were wait and get. I asked for 32 and got 32. I asked for 64pages and got 64. No issues whatsoever
6/26/21, 17:55 - +234 802 474 1100: You na govt pikin na! 

Even that you guy made me wait well o 😀😂
6/26/21, 17:55 - +234 802 474 1100: Your guy*
6/26/21, 17:57 - Dee: 😀 you want Chris to come for me bah? 

Chris i don't know anyone in government o. Never have. Don't know what Eugene is talking about o.
6/26/21, 18:07 - +234 802 474 1100: 😂

Chris needs to know that you have your perks/connections in high places sef...
6/26/21, 18:37 - Dee: Ha, How innocent people dey go prison no pass like this o.

I no know anybody o. I no dey among.
6/26/21, 19:34 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): 🤣
6/26/21, 20:59 - +234 803 075 0650: Nobody in government offended me o. The only reason I'm focusing on the government is that there is no alternative to government. Gather the best of the private sector, they can't do the work of the government. 
In the 1990s, the West gave up on African governments and decided to channel their development aids through NGOs. Currently there are close to 20,000 NGOs working in Africa alone. Yet the problems in Africa continue to worsen. There's no bypassing the government
6/26/21, 21:05 - Benedict: How far with this? Lemme know and be saving my coins 🙈. Sorry Chris for the segue 😁
6/28/21, 00:04 - Kenneth Maths. US.: All of u talking too much here, make una act and change 9ja! @2348024741100 wee be giving all the whole analysis in the world but is working in another man's land, @2348030750650 is there attacking the 9ja govt from the abroad....how d 9ja wan con take good

6/28/21, 00:17 - Kenneth Maths. US.: My miracle nor be here o.....3months after i still never see d passport
6/28/21, 00:29 - Kenneth Maths. US.: 1. I call their office for Atlanta tire (at least 7 times a day for at least a week) to get info, nobody to pick

2. I summon courage apply with one mind on *March 4, 2021*

3. They say once u pay you will be given a date to appear for fingerprints (that one na scam)

4. After paying tru the portal, the pop up say, no interview date available, contact the consulate for a date (the same pipu wey nor de pick call)

5. I got info i could do walk in, but i wee need to bring in $100 Money order ( *money order that must not be addressed to anyone*) aside the $107 i pay online for renewal o

6. I decide to walk in 2 days after as i need to travel soon

6/28/21, 00:35 - Kenneth Maths. US.: 8. We enter Atlanta and we got to the consulate at about 6:15am, we had about 5 pipu ahead of us already

9. See as dem lock us outside the gate like criminals and were attending to us from the other side. 

10. We even had to pay $20 to park again.

6/28/21, 00:41 - Kenneth Maths. US.: The idiots that started working around 9 stopped at about 11am, because the only man out ofq all of them in that office doing the work, had to go for lunch for 1hr and we watch am drive out and till im come back dem nor attend to anybody.

We Eventually left there at about 1pm
6/28/21, 00:41 - Benedict: Are u not going to apply for naija tourist visa so🤣🤣

Imagine raising ur voice (shouting) at a 2yr old saying he shld stay still for a passport/picture

The power of institutions: Lessons from the United States
Christopher Akor
Donald Trump, the amoral former United States President, spent the last five to six years bullying the entire Republican Party to submission. It basically became the party of Donald Trump and the ruling ideology was Trumpism and anything Trump believes in. Anyone within the Republican establishment who disagrees with him is tagged a RINO (Republican in name only) and banished.  With Trump firmly controlling the base of the party, many principled Republican congressmen and women and state elected officials that had dared to disagree with him have suffered crushing political defeats. Trump became the Republican Party and the Republican Party became Trump.
Of course, Trump was on a high. He thought the 2020 election will be a walk in the park; and he was right. He was in total control of the Republican party; has had  a record total of 234 ultra-conservative judgeship nominees appointed and confirmed by the United State Senate, including three associate justices of the Supreme Court, 54 judges for the US courts of appeals, 174 judges for the US district courts, and three judges for the US Court of International trade; delivered a huge tax cut in 2017 (corporate tax was cut from 35% to 21%) that boosted the economy and the job markets with unemployment figures crashing to 3.5 percent, the lowest since 1969. What was more, the Democrat party seems to be in disarray since the defeat of 2016 and doesn’t seem to know how to effectively confront or checkmate Trump.
Then Covid-19 happened and Trump correctly diagnosed it as bad news. He thus initially ignored it, downplayed it, peddled in or indulged conspiracy theorists and touted bogus cures for the virus.  As his polls numbers plunged he got more desperate. He began selling the idea that he cannot lose the election except it was stolen from him, and accused Democrats, without evidence, of a grand scheme to rig the elections especially through mail-in-voting.
In any case, he believed he will successfully have the election results tossed out and reclaim another mandate through the Supreme Court (he successfully nominated three of its six conservative members and they must remain loyal to him) or get the state legislators, board of electors, board of canvassers or even congress reject the results of the election thereby clearing the way for his election by Congress, where Republicans control a majority of states.
Of course, we knew how it played out. He lost the elections, started projecting the big lie that he won the election but it was stolen from him, got his lawyers to file over 64 lawsuits contesting election processes, vote counting, and the vote certification process in multiple states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Almost all the suits were dismissed in all the states – even by Trump appointed and conservative judges as baseless and lacking in evidence or merit.  The Supreme Court also dealt the Trump election lawsuits a death blow when it refused to even entertain one of the bogus lawsuits brought by a fawning Taxes Attorney General  (later joined by about 18 Republican states) to overturn election results in key battleground states where Biden won.
Despite Trump’s immense popularity and his absolute control of the Republican party and its base, he could not succeed in any of the elaborate schemes to get the results of the election overturned in any of the states involved, including in Georgia where ultra-conservatives control all levers of power and are unapologetically Trumpian.
Aaron Van Langevelde, a 40 year old lawyer and loyal Republican in Michigan exemplified the challenge Trump faced but never expected. Van Langevelde is a staunch Republican. He works for Republicans in the statehouse, giving legal advice to advance Republican causes and win Republican campaigns. He represented the kind of Republican with ambition and future in the party. As a reward, he was appointed by the party into the Michigan state’s board of election canvassers (made up of two Democrats and Republics each) - the body that certifies all state-wide elections in Michigan.  His mandate – as handed down by the state and national party chairs and by Donald Trump – was to delay or even outrightly refuse to certify the state’s election results, which Biden won, even if all 83 counties in the state have certified their results.
But at the meeting of the state board of canvassers on November 23, Langelvelde damned everyone and everything and voted to certify the state’s election result with the following statement: “We must not attempt to exercise power we simply don’t have....As John Adams once said, ‘we are a government of laws, not men.’ This board needs to adhere to that principle here today. This board must do its part to uphold the rule of law and comply with our legal duty to certify this election.” Georgia’s governor, secretary of state, and states’ board of canvassers, and even Trump’s ultra-loyal Vice President, Mike Pence, when faced with the prospect of breaking the law to do Trump’s wish, simply refused.  
Unlike what most Nigerians and Africans were thinking and arguing, the ultimate test of the maturity of a democratic system is not the conduct of individuals, but the capacity of the system to constrain such behaviours. As James Comey, former FBI Director, argued recently in an Op-ed; “since the beginning, the United States has built a system with bad and incompetent leaders in mind.” Frederick Douglass puts it better: “Our government may be in the hands of a bad man...We ought to have our government so shaped that even when in the hands of a bad man we shall be safe.”   
 Clearly, the American system has passed a critical stress test. That is the lesson African democracies should be learning and not focusing on the bizarre conduct of Trump!
 
6/29/21, 13:14 - +234 803 075 0650: I wrote it while sipping wine in the dining of @14692437489 in Florida🤪
6/29/21, 13:21 - Dee: I think you actually made my point for me. 

Trump could not overturn the election because a few people refused to break the law. 

So if we are calling institutions "rule of law" then we have institutions as well. Because we have the 1999 constitution. But the law cannot start enforcing itself. We Nigerians have to enforce it. 

But do we follow it? 

So using what u posted, it wasn't the "rule of law"  that saved America. It was because a few people in trumps camp refused to break it.
6/29/21, 13:27 - +234 803 075 0650: The point you keep missing is that those individuals didn't act because of their conscience. It's fear of consequences. All those who aided Nixon in the Watergate scandal all went to jail even if Nixon was pardoned by President Ford
6/29/21, 14:50 - +234 803 075 0650: Institutions are actually designed to structure, incentivise and discourage behaviors. So, if you see individuals behavior in a particular way, look at the incentive structure. There lies the institutions
6/29/21, 16:04 - +234 802 474 1100: Thanks @2348126296642 ! I owe you one bottle

6/29/21, 16:08 - +234 803 075 0650: Maybe I need to write an article on how exactly institutions work to structure and influence human behavior. I used to think it was obvious before🙈
6/29/21, 16:10 - Kenneth Maths. US.: That is how they have forgotten this👆🏽 and the primary reason for this group.

6/29/21, 16:13 - Bootylicious Honeypie: <Media omitted>
6/29/21, 17:46 - Dee: But fear of consequences is also what makes some Nigerians, that are supposed to enforce the law, look the other way. Hence rendering the "institutions" useless.   Like a lawyer thinking of sueing Jagaban.
6/29/21, 17:48 - Dee: But the American institutions didn't make Trump an asshole. We can't blame the American institutions for that
6/29/21, 17:49 - Dee: Bottle with "dorime" abi without?

Nigerians will never learn. Everyday different forms of MMM keeps springing up and they always fall for them
6/30/21, 13:47 - Dee: This thing is greed. 

First of all, never do a high risk investment with money you are not willing to lose.

Secondly, these people are smart. They will pay out once or twice to get you hooked. Then run you street
6/30/21, 13:49 - +234 803 075 0650: That is not smartness. That's gullibility. The fraudsters have always followed the same template. No change whatsoever
6/30/21, 14:03 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): To be honest through, the options for credible investment in Nigeria context is limited due to high risk. Some people may just fall into the trap because somebody they know and trust tell them it is legit
6/30/21, 14:13 - Kenneth Maths. US.: The situation people find themselves could also play a critical role.

Although this is not MMM in nature but let me share.

There is this man we went to the same school together, he finished his Ph.D. about a year after me, he is about 60yrs old, he lectures at that Nigeria College of aviation in Zaria. About 3months ago he buzzed me with this msg
6/30/21, 14:14 - Kenneth Maths. US.: <Media omitted>
6/30/21, 14:19 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Of course his last msg was just to ask if he could use me.

I called him afterwards and ask him which opportunity did he get and he said he got an email saying he was one of the lucky winners in the US DV lottery for this year.
My first question to him afterwards was: Did you apply for any lottery? He said no. Next, do yoh know that Nigeria is no longer on the list of countries that are eligible,  he said but i got an email.

I asked to see a copy of the email, after scrutinizing, the 1st thing o saw was the senders email, which can never be from the DHS moreso, i dug further into the forms they were asking him to fill, some don't exist and others were not related to the class of visa they claim he was selected for. After plenty talk i was able to convince him it was a scam.
6/30/21, 14:21 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Days after, he said he wanted to do it for his kids.

Ffwd to 2months after, his wife died. Apparently she has been suffering from cancer and he had been going tru a lot financially and mentally
6/30/21, 14:21 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): As in. Awareness and level of 'education' + exposure - in quotes because na life / street education na im sure pass
6/30/21, 14:21 - Dee: Yeah. How gullible people are too helps
6/30/21, 14:22 - Dee: True that
6/30/21, 14:22 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Desperation join...multiple elements and dimensions
6/30/21, 14:23 - Kenneth Maths. US.: So he was obviously not able to think properly and do little checks for himself....
6/30/21, 14:24 - Dee: Eiya. His condition sort of clouded his judgement.
6/30/21, 14:24 - Dee: Yeah
6/30/21, 14:24 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Maybe that too.....

So my brother @2348030750650 i don't think it is just *gullibility*
6/30/21, 14:28 - +234 803 075 0650: OK o. But your friend too how much is his salary a month? I remember universities in Nigeria trying to recruit me. I was blunt to them. The salary you'll pay me can't even pay for my rent. So no need.
6/30/21, 14:31 - Kenneth Maths. US.: I am not privy to his salary info. But I would think that he was earning quite ok.... He was a step close to a director (don't really know how their syst works) or so b4 he graduted and his graduation was sppse to push him there.
6/30/21, 14:46 - +234 803 075 0650: OK may be relative o. You know no Nigerian professor earns up to $1000 as monthly salary abi?
6/30/21, 18:27 - Dee: That is too much of a general statement to make. Unless you know the salary of every professor in Nigeria, it is impossible to be that certain.  After all,  $1000 is just 500K.
6/30/21, 18:32 - Dee: <Media omitted>
6/30/21, 18:34 - +234 803 075 0650: They have a salary scale. Even private universities follow that scale.
6/30/21, 19:00 - Dee: Maybe the salary scale you saw hasn't been updated yet.  cos I just confirmed from a brand new PhD person. And the person said some do collect above 500K.
6/30/21, 19:02 - Bootylicious Honeypie: @2348126296642 ...epp me read my PM
6/30/21, 19:02 - Dee: That aside, I know 500k as salary isn't bad. But I don't think it is a good thing that we are even arguing 500K for a professor. They should be earing more than that. Way more than that without having to work for oil companies like some geology profs. Phd isn't easy to get.
6/30/21, 19:02 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Also, i don't know about 9ja but here, depending on what kind of grant you can bring to the dept or school, salaries are never same irrespective of any defined scale the school uses
6/30/21, 19:06 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Infact, at other times how you came into the school as a lecturer, in terms of who you know (at my own Florida Tech at least) your salary fit pass the person dem employ u with at the same time for the same level and or experience
6/30/21, 19:06 - Dee: *earning
6/30/21, 19:07 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): I can't be the only one that observed this 😄. Madam Judy bringing the matter to family meeting (tatafo wee nor kee me!)

7/1/21, 06:34 - +234 803 075 0650: Re-examining the leadership deficit in Africa
Christopher Akor
There is no denying the reality that Africa is the poorest part of the world. It is not for nothing that the continent is still referred to as the ‘dark continent’ renowned mainly for wars, famine, poverty and brutal dictators. A look through the yearly United Nations Human Develop Index will show African countries occupying the lower rungs of the index. Even the success of the Western-led democratisation drive of the 1990s and 2000s has not changed the fortune of the continent. While the one party states and brutal dictators of the 60s and 70s have been replaced by multi-party democracies and elected leaders, the quality of governance hasn’t substantially improved. In fact, going by all credible macroeconomic indicators, much of the region has not only experienced stagnation but evident retrogression in the decades since independence.
In trying to explain this shocking phenomenon of almost universal failure in Africa, scholars have advanced different theories from geography/climatic conditions, colonial antecedents, investments, reforms, and most recently leadership. Aside the scholars who cited geography and climatic conditions for Africa’s poor performances, most African and pan-Africanist scholars devoted decades to showing why colonialism, neo-colonialism and the imbalance in the relations and trade between the metropols and African states have made it difficult or impossible for African states to make progress. However, that argument has now run its full course with the rapid successes and growth of East Asian states. Even as African economies were failing in the 60s and 70s, issues of growth and development were still mainly viewed as politically neutral or even above politics. What were required for growth and development, it was thought, were the influx of foreign investment and implementation of a wide range of public sector reforms. Consequently, the Bretton Woods institutions prescribed and compelled distressed African states to adopt the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) as the sure best way of resuscitating their ailing economies and achieving economic growth.
It was only when the SAP failed across board that attention began to shift to the quality of leadership in Africa. The solution to the leadership problem, it was thought, was liberal democracy. And with the end of the Cold War, the United States with its western partners began an aggressive campaign to democratise African countries. That campaign was hugely successful. The third wave of democratisation swept through almost 48 African countries. Subsequently, emphasis was placed on improving the nature of democracies. And that too was largely successful. In 1990, almost no country in Africa had set a constitutional term limit for leaders. However, by the turn of the century, over 30 have inserted term limits in their constitutions and now hold multiparty elections with a good record of alternation of power among political parties. Still yet, governance only marginally improved.
The Sudanese billionaire, Mo Ibrahim, was so concerned about the problem of leadership in Africa that he set up the world’s largest leadership prize to reward democratically elected African leaders who respect their constitutions and leave office when their tenure ends and who demonstrate some leadership qualities. “I’m ashamed. We really need to resolve the problem and the problem, in our view, is bad leadership and bad governance,” Ibrahim concluded. But even with the prize and many attempts to improve the quality of leadership, governments across Africa has yet to improve. Advocates of good governance in Africa have now resorted to moral suasion and training of potential leaders in governance to prepare them for future leadership.
But, why has leadership, with very few exceptions, been generally disappointing in Africa and below global levels? This question becomes imperative considering that the East Asian Tigers were not even democracies when they were posting impressive economic growth. Increasingly, evidence is pointing to one factor – the weakness or failure of institutions. Nowhere else are state institutions so weak, absent or even ignored altogether in governance than in Africa. As political theorists and scholars of African politics have surmised, the state is Africa is just a decoy, a pseudo-Western facade masking, as it were, deeply personalised political relations, and that whatever formal institutions exist are largely devoid of authority. African leaders have perfected the art of isomorphic mimicry – the creation of institutions that act in ways to make themselves look like institutions in other places that are perceived as legitimate, but which, in reality, are not. That is why despite the placing of term limits in most constitutions, leaders generally do not respect the term limits and easily get the parliaments to re-write the rules to favour them.
At the root of this proclivity to abolish or bypass institutions and centre governance around themselves is a total dislike for accountability. Once elected or catapulted into office, African leaders feel they are the embodiment of the will of the people and do not need to render account to anyone or be subjected to the various institutions of restraints that mature democracies erect to prevent abuse of power. Parliaments are often packed with loyalists and or ignored completely. The judiciary is compromised or intimidated while the press is simply muzzled. There is no order, no predictability and officials behave as they like since there are no institutions to moderate their conduct. The East Asian countries, even though not democracies, possessed some ‘redeeming features’ of good governance and democracy such as accountability, predictability, the rule of law (according to their own internal disciplines) and competition in designated spheres that helped propelled their growth.
Institutions are the basic building blocks of a prosperous and sustainable society. Wise societies therefore who devote time and effort to building strong institutions (read a capable state), which, in the words of Ricardo Hausmann, “can protect the country and its people, keep the peace, enforce rules and contracts, provide infrastructure and social services, regulate economic activities, credibly enter into inter-temporal obligations, and tax society to pay for it all” are ultimately successful while those that depend on rule by philosopher kings, moralists and strongmen are not and ultimately become poor. The choice before Africa is clear.

7/1/21, 12:59 - +234 802 474 1100: Thanks for the recogntion Chairwoman! 😁

We your committeemembers pay homage

7/1/21, 15:05 - +234 803 075 0650: 😏😏😏
7/2/21, 07:26 - Dee: Good morning gender that ate the forbidden fruit first and the gender that betrayed Jesus. 

Question:- is anyone travelling out of 9ja but not buying full PTA?
7/2/21, 08:23 - +234 803 075 0650: Oga go and visit your malam🤪🤪🤪
7/2/21, 08:30 - Dee: 😀 
Unfortunately,  aboki is 500. PTA is 410. Since  Wifey didn't allow me get a sugar mummy, and I am not related to dangote, I have to go with PTA.
7/2/21, 08:43 - +234 803 075 0650: I understand. But you see why we are an unserious country abi? How do you create such a system of arbitrage and expect people not to abuse it?
7/2/21, 08:44 - +234 802 474 1100: Chris don start again😁
7/2/21, 08:46 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): The real question is, did Chris ever stop?! 🤷🏽‍♀️
7/2/21, 08:46 - +234 803 075 0650: But that's what gave Emiefele a second term na - selling cheap dollars to the cabal😏
7/2/21, 08:58 - +234 803 072 5702: abi. At least Sanusi Lamido confirmed this much. He's probably the longest surviving political appointee till date...
7/2/21, 09:06 - +234 803 075 0650: No CBN governor since 1999 has ever had a second term except Emiefele. Guy was just selling cheap dollars to northern cabals and printing money anyhow for Buhari to spend. As at the last count, he's illegally printed almost N10 trillion for the government since 2015
7/2/21, 09:06 - +234 802 474 1100: I dont do innuendos and accusations
7/2/21, 09:07 - +234 802 474 1100: Chris o! How do you even begin to back up this statement
7/2/21, 09:07 - +234 803 075 0650: Yeah. You do NTA news
7/2/21, 09:07 - +234 803 072 5702: 😂
7/2/21, 09:07 - +234 802 474 1100: I do actually.

7/2/21, 09:11 - +234 803 075 0650: This is since 2017. See Doyin Salami's remarks as a member of the CBN monetary policy committee.
7/2/21, 09:12 - +234 803 075 0650: It has gotten worse since then
7/2/21, 09:12 - +234 802 474 1100: I read this bros. Yes if you have access you can get more PTA. Same with pretty much everything anywhere: with access you can get more

The accusation/conclusion i am challenging is *Thats what kept him till date, selling cheap dollars to the cabal + Till date he has printed illegal 10trillion.
7/2/21, 09:14 - +234 802 474 1100: Saying CBN has been printing illegal 10trillion is with all due respect - oversimplifying legal govt lending. And honestly a crooked way for the media to portray it. Just makes for juicy news
7/2/21, 09:16 - +234 802 474 1100: Lets debate on what proportion of direct govt lending is comfortable rather than put a label of illegality just because you want yo make news juicier
7/2/21, 09:17 - +234 802 474 1100: The US has *printed* trillions of dollars to get their economy out of the doldrums
7/2/21, 09:17 - +234 803 075 0650: I don't do sensationalism. What is the legal requirement for CBN lending to the government? 5% of revenues. What has Emiefele been doing since? Printing free money for the government while mopping up money from the banks to contain rising inflation.
7/2/21, 09:17 - +234 802 474 1100: If you watch Fox news- the US president is commiting a felony
7/2/21, 09:17 - +234 802 474 1100: If you watch CNN, the president is saving the economy
7/2/21, 09:18 - +234 803 075 0650: This is as comparing apples to oranges really. It makes me laugh. What's the inflation rate in the US and Nigeria?
7/2/21, 09:18 - +234 802 474 1100: Its not. Youare simply cherry pickingnews to fit your story line
7/2/21, 09:19 - +234 803 075 0650: The US borrows every dime from the Feds and pays back. There's absolutely no way Buhari or Nigerian state governments are ever going to pay back CBN lendings. You and I know that
7/2/21, 09:21 - +234 802 474 1100: https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/03/25/where-is-the-u-s-government-getting-all-the-money-its-spending-in-the-coronavirus-crisis/
7/2/21, 09:22 - +234 803 075 0650: Any attempt by the CBN to deduct its credit to the states will automatically lead to state collapse. Is that lending?
7/2/21, 09:22 - +234 802 474 1100: For those who want to understand govt lending a bit more especially during a recession/pandemic take a read
7/2/21, 09:22 - +234 803 075 0650: Abeg I'm going back to bed jare😏
7/2/21, 09:22 - +234 802 474 1100: 😛

@2348024741100 see your govt. So how do they get money to run the country? Quantitative easing (printing money)🤪🤪🤪
7/2/21, 10:43 - +234 802 474 1100: I see you have dropped the illegality argument in favor of the American term _ quantitative easing.

That at least is a better truer story
7/2/21, 10:44 - +234 803 075 0650: It is still illegal printing of money. Read the rules governing the CBN
7/2/21, 10:47 - +234 803 075 0650: They used to lie to you people that the reason the Naira is losing value was because of the collapse of oil prices. Now oil prices is rising but the Naira keeps depreciating 
The simple reason is the CBN keeps printing the bloody thing for the government. No wonder no serious business save their money in Naira
7/2/21, 11:03 - +234 802 474 1100: Chris o!!! I dont even know where to start with this one 😳

7/3/21, 19:39 - +234 803 075 0650: Yet the UK has vaccinated almost 60% of its population while Nigeria hasn't vaccinated even 1% of its population with free vaccine donated to it🤪
7/3/21, 19:41 - +234 803 075 0650: This is even besides the person doing the posting. She was sent to Nigeria by CNN to help them make money from advert and run the Nigerian office and she turned it into a slave camp exploiting her workers, refusing to pay them just to fund her staying in Ikoyi and her vacations in London😏
7/3/21, 19:53 - +234 802 474 1100: lol.. see how fast you have run away from a simple conclusion. Tests in Nigeria are cheaper than the UK... 😀... same quality PCR tests 😀

Suddenly you are attacking the person that brought you good news 😂
7/3/21, 19:54 - +234 803 075 0650: Why wont they be cheaper. Weren't the equipments donated almost free to them?
7/3/21, 19:54 - +234 802 474 1100: Plus the use of tech with QR codes   as against manual
7/3/21, 19:55 - +234 802 474 1100: On this one you have just misttepped
7/3/21, 19:56 - +234 803 075 0650: It's true o that you coming to this chat group is just to me and fight me🤪🤪🤪🤪
7/3/21, 19:56 - +234 802 474 1100: PCR tests capacity is driven by private innovation supported by robust Governmemt involvement.
My team was involved with the various procurements - 😀😜
7/3/21, 19:56 - +234 802 474 1100: I am trying to help balance your writing... while having fun doing so 😜
7/3/21, 19:57 - +234 803 075 0650: So all the ones donated by WHO and Jack Ma foundation nko? What happened to them?🤪
7/3/21, 19:58 - +234 803 075 0650: Oga leave me alone before @447788152190 go come post another two-fighting video
7/3/21, 20:00 - Kenneth Maths. US.: @2348024741100 just out of curiosity on that money part.
How easy is it to earn #50k in 9ja and £358(which i suppose is for 2 pipu, i.e 179 each) in UK?
7/3/21, 20:03 - +234 803 075 0650: No mind am. I also still purchase medications produced by Pfizer and GSK cheaper in Nigeria than in the US. Hail Nigeria👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
7/3/21, 20:07 - +234 803 075 0650: @2348024741100 makes me remember the guy who did a viral post recently about how living in Nigeria is better than living in the US because in Nigeria if you're economical you can eat breakfast and lunch with $1 while in the US you can't.
7/3/21, 20:11 - +234 802 474 1100: What are you comparing bros na ? This is travel PCR? You réalise the people involved here abi ?

Abi make I go ask the people for Pekham in London how much them Dey earn
7/3/21, 20:12 - +234 802 474 1100: Lmao! And it is his reality! You need to respect it that your own « truth » is different 😀😂
7/3/21, 20:13 - +234 802 474 1100: As usual Chris don succeed to move conversation rather than say oh Nigeria’s PCR tests are cheaper, why is that? Even though the reagents are sourced internationally?
7/3/21, 20:13 - +234 803 075 0650: Until I proved to him that someone earning minimum wage in New York ($15/hour) makes 2 months minimum wage (N30k/month) of the Nigerian worker in a day
7/3/21, 20:14 - +234 802 474 1100: And I would have told you what the Nigerian team did well... shikena 😀
7/3/21, 20:14 - +234 802 474 1100: But No! Nigeria can’t do anything well
7/3/21, 20:16 - +234 802 474 1100: You do realize that it’s not just cheaper in Nigeria! It’s cheaper everywhere else BUT the US... but another topic for another day
7/3/21, 20:17 - +234 803 075 0650: You can see how you continue to major in the minor and forget the most important thing, which is fighting to rescue the country. If you're happy with Nigeria as it is, it's your choice and you're within your rights. Me, I can't settle for Nigeria as it is. I'll continue to fight for a better Nigeria
7/3/21, 20:17 - +234 802 474 1100: 😀
We are both fighting the same fight my brother! I am just helping fill up your stories of Nigeria
7/3/21, 20:18 - +234 803 075 0650: Of course I know and I know why. The same American companies sell them very cheap to others and make it expensive for Americans
7/3/21, 20:18 - +234 803 075 0650: We're not.
7/3/21, 20:18 - +234 802 474 1100: Nope! It’s a really faulty American healthcare system
7/3/21, 20:19 - +234 802 474 1100: It’s not about the companies
7/3/21, 20:19 - +234 802 474 1100: It is cheaper in the UK, Europe and elsewhere regardless of where the company is based
7/3/21, 20:20 - +234 803 075 0650: Well, they argue they need that money to invest heavily in research and development  - and truly they're the world leaders. 
Don't start attacking me now as if I support them
7/3/21, 20:21 - +234 802 474 1100: This is where you can freely use the word institutions : the USA lacks robust health institutions regarding pricing😀
7/3/21, 20:22 - +234 802 474 1100: In many ways it isn’t a free market
7/3/21, 20:22 - +234 803 075 0650: Deliberately made so by Congress
7/3/21, 20:22 - Kenneth Maths. US.: All i need is an answer to my question let me see how much sense it makes to compare the cost of PCR test in 9ja and UK
7/3/21, 20:23 - +234 802 474 1100: By this logic... then y’all shouldn’t  compare ANYTHING between both countries
7/3/21, 20:24 - Kenneth Maths. US.: See as una take de fail exam? How are u different from chris u always attack now
7/3/21, 20:24 - +234 802 474 1100: Chris readily compares a country with 200yrs of democracy with Nigeria...
7/3/21, 20:25 - +234 802 474 1100: Exactly... I’m not using the logic... I’m just showing that you can’t pick and choose
7/3/21, 20:25 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Chris, this boi just make me drag ur name where i nor sppse drag am go jare🏃🏽‍♂️🏃🏽‍♂️
7/3/21, 20:25 - +234 803 075 0650: no worry yourself. @2348024741100 will never answer your question. He'll beat about the Bush all day
7/3/21, 20:26 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Abeg make i go find money jare! My ticket money to 9ja never complete 😅
7/3/21, 20:26 - +234 802 474 1100: Nice... situation is bad! But it was deliberately made bad by Congress! Nice décence
7/3/21, 20:28 - +234 802 474 1100: 😂😂😂
Bros the bush is simply that PCR tests are cheaper in Nigeria !!

N’a you beat everywhere but the bush 😀

Just ask why? Why is it cheaper? All the how much do people earn? And whether them donate some? N’a you bring am enter
7/3/21, 20:30 - +234 802 474 1100: No wahala! When u land watch out for our almost completed new international wing and the already completed airport road! 😜
7/4/21, 11:21 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Good morning my neighbours!

PSA for those looking to renew naija passport:
A new law was passed last month that no passport processing should take less than 6weeks. Unless you go directly to head office in Abuja where you may get it within 2weeks.
7/4/21, 11:22 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): I say lemme informate you people in case you were thinking wait and get. For now, while the law is fresh, most immigration contacts will abide. 
Go with God!
7/4/21, 11:46 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: I wan do for Adanna, I’ve already received the 6weeks information. I just jeje do ecowas own first
7/4/21, 11:58 - Dee: Oh boy

7/5/21, 13:39 - +234 802 474 1100: Madness indeed! It’s gone crazy with security really!

But Yep I still do! I’m an Arsenal fan remember 😅
7/5/21, 14:08 - Dee: Don't watch football, but even i understand that arsenal fan remark. 

If i had a company, and I needed people that would stay with company, even if it was at the precipice of destruction, I would make "Arsenal fan" my number one criteria
7/5/21, 14:11 - Kenneth Maths. US.: May God not let any one of us these madness come close to our families or loved ones.... that will make us realize that there is no country o!

These are all just numbers until it touches us personally I guess.
7/5/21, 14:32 - +234 802 474 1100: Nigeria is a failed country !!!
Terrible! No hope for thé country!
7/5/21, 14:33 - +234 802 474 1100: I have said it o! 
Is that all you wanted? I can add more!
7/5/21, 14:33 - +234 802 474 1100: 😒
7/5/21, 14:33 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Idgiot🤣
7/5/21, 14:34 - +234 803 075 0650: No. Nigeria is the best country is the best country in the world🤪🤪🤪🤪
7/5/21, 14:35 - +234 802 474 1100: I have tried man! I have tried to get you to consider that your view is biased and not the single story about Nigeria! but you refuse! 😀

You seem to see it as binary ! Nigeria is either good or bad, failed or thriving etc
7/5/21, 14:35 - +234 802 474 1100: There is a whole spectrum between those two extremes.... 

I have abandoned this cause 🤪🤪🤣
7/5/21, 14:36 - +234 803 075 0650: Please don't abandon the cause. Continue......
7/5/21, 14:36 - +234 802 474 1100: I will now feed you only terrible news about Nigeria ....
7/5/21, 14:36 - +234 802 474 1100: No o!!! Don’t beg me 😜
7/5/21, 14:39 - +234 803 075 0650: I don't care about your so-called good news. I'm concerned  about the bigger picture: is Nigeria flourishing? It is protecting lives and property of people? Are it's institutions working? These are my concerns not one or two single stories of someone doing something good. I listen to that daily. Our churches are booming, our pastors are getting richer and buying private jets all over the place and mouthing wonderful testimonies of the goodness of God.
7/5/21, 14:51 - +234 802 474 1100: And in all of this? Your verdict is still binary right? Nigeria is either flourishing or it is not. 

And that’s all I have a problem with . If u visualiser the conversation about Nigeria as a battery 🔋. Your stance always makes it seem like Nigeria is at 0%, where as I am asking to consider that it is realistically at 30 or 40 (this is just arbitrary before @447788152190 and @2348028945332 will pick on this little bit and say it is not accurate) and write a few times on the 30 or 40% good. Explore the learnings there and argue for how that can be amplified across multiple sectors.

But No! Any talk of a good in Nigeria makes you uncomfortable as if it somehow attacks your opinion that Nigeria is not in a good state.
7/5/21, 14:54 - +234 803 075 0650: We're returning to the stone age. I've done so many analyses showing Nigeria is falling behind on ALL indices of good governance, security, economic growth and even failed state index. Yet, your only concern is on highlighting one or two success stories. My friend go and make your money in Cote D'ivoire and other countries and leave us alone to face our challenges 😏
7/5/21, 15:22 - +234 802 474 1100: Lol @one or two success stories.

Again if you reflect and believe that you have been constructive in your criticism and that your intent with writing is to spur change and not to simply Nigeria bash like everyone else on social media, then that’s ok. Else I invite you to incorporate the feedback 

Thasall
7/5/21, 15:50 - Dee: 😀😀 

Peer pressure. 

Naija has been good to me sha. I seem to be able to find my way or get my way with almost everything
7/5/21, 16:16 - +234 803 075 0650: Bros, Nigeria has been very good to so many people, but almost always at the expense of others (the majority). That's the problem.
7/5/21, 16:24 - Dee: Well, you have a point there.
7/5/21, 16:39 - Kenneth Maths. US.: They wee come and ask you for the numbers to back this up now😁
7/5/21, 16:41 - +234 802 474 1100: 😀 Glad to see that you have taken over 😀
7/5/21, 16:41 - Kenneth Maths. US.: No i have not taken over, i am only saging that is *your favorite line* to him😝

7/5/21, 16:43 - +234 802 474 1100: lol... how can I tackle that one.... he said Nigeria has been good to many people (possible 49% of the population) at the expense of the majority(the remaining 51%) 😀
7/5/21, 16:47 - +234 803 072 5702: Nigeria has been good to 49%? He be like say you don get side-gig for Whatsapp to help them trigger conversations here...😒

7/6/21, 11:33 - Dee: I think, at this point, it is better  to assume ( even erroneously ) that everywhere in the North isn't safe
7/6/21, 11:34 - Kenneth Maths. US.: No o, everywhere is overreaching, pls provide numbers to satisfy that man hidding in Abidjan
7/6/21, 11:34 - Benedict: I'll do you 1 better. It's better to assume everywhere in Nigeria isn't safe.
7/6/21, 11:34 - Benedict: Cos it really isn't

7/6/21, 16:35 - +234 802 971 7134: Oh well. Were the shootings not even worse with the other guy? I remember when there were shootings like everyday
7/6/21, 16:35 - Kenneth Maths. US.: The same country u are scared of is the same "useless" and "insecured" country you came to "secure" the future of your 2 kids abi?
7/6/21, 16:36 - +234 803 075 0650: Yet each time una wan born, una go run come the US wey no safe. Hypocrisy no go kii you😏
7/6/21, 16:36 - Kenneth Maths. US.: I asked what your point was and you said "No point".
7/6/21, 16:56 - Dee: Una wait o. I think I get what Eugene is trying to say/do. 

This is kind of what CNN did to Trump. CNN wasn't fake news. But it was biased as hell. Thankfully too, cos that criminal  would have won a second term.  

I am sure Trump did some good things. But CNN only focused on the bad and there were soo many of those that they never ran out of things to say. If you are objective enough, you will see some good he did.  

In the same way, I think what Eugene is saying is, there are definitely bad things happening everywhere in Nigeria. And they didn't start with this current administration or even the one before. 

But if you are objective enough, you may find some good. 

Doesn't mean you won't leave the country if the opportunity presents itself. But you can be objective enough to say it is not all bad. 

I think he posted those things about US to show that other countries too have things the rest of the world consider bad. 

After all, that is why people stay away from some parts of the US cos of prevalence of gun violence, in your face racism, etc. Doesn't make the whole US bad. 

Just how I interpret what he has been trying to do sha
7/6/21, 17:01 - Dee: Chris is typing o. Who send me message now?
7/6/21, 17:03 - +234 803 075 0650: No. What @2348024741100 is saying is that bad things happen in your so-called God's own country too. So, keep quiet. That's the assumption anyway. And before you ask me where he said so, I'll tell you. Assumptions are never stated. They're deduced from an argument. 
But it's a pathetic attempt. 
You country is failure and unraveling from all sides and all you want us to do is talk about the little good things in the country instead of talking about what matters and how to save the country?
7/6/21, 17:06 - Dee: I love that last line. I really do. How can we save this country? 
Other than shooting everyone from the president all the way down to local government chairman and using their body for manure to grow our Agric sector. (This is my preferred method)
7/6/21, 17:08 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Beht, manure will epp food to grow, solving the hunger problem in the land 🤧🚶🏽‍♀️
7/6/21, 17:08 - +234 803 075 0650: Saving the country is a collective method unfortunately. The people have to be United to demand change. There's no room for messiahship.
7/6/21, 17:09 - Benedict: Eugene and Deji are in the same WhatsApp group sha 🤦🏾‍♂️🤣🤣🤣😂😂
7/6/21, 17:10 - +234 802 971 7134: <Media omitted>
7/6/21, 17:10 - +234 803 075 0650: And how will people be United to damage change when they're not collectively agreed that things are bad and are untenable. And when we have people like @2348024741100 hellbent on trying to prove that the country is still doing well
7/6/21, 17:12 - Dee: That solution is just the best. 
Godfatherism? Solved. 
Bad Influence? Solved. 
High Cost of governance? Solved 
Incompetent people in power? Solved. 
Lack of manure? Solved. 
Just clean d slate and start over.
7/6/21, 17:15 - Dee: But how can we unite? We can't even unite variations in people of the same tribe. 

Take yoruba for example? Osun feels Ijebu is stingy and can't be trusted. Ijebu thinks ogbomosho is lazy. Ogbomosho thinks ibadan is fetish. All are yoruba. 

I am sure there are some parts of igbo too that don't like the others. 

So how can we make this work?
7/6/21, 17:19 - Dee: 😀 no o. I am very much a member of the "japa movement".
7/6/21, 17:19 - Dee: Wawu
7/6/21, 17:41 - +234 802 474 1100: Chai see attack o! Just for sharing news that is on the front page of CNN o 😂😂🤣
7/6/21, 17:44 - +234 802 474 1100: I have repeated it... 
at the first opportunity we will cast our ballots and vote out this government. 

But if the enjoyment is Nigeria bashing, the internet is full of the craziness that sometimes describes the America that @2348030750650 describes with « institutions ». I only shared the tip of the iceberg; you should try reading Fox News whether you sef no go attack Capitol Hill.
7/6/21, 17:50 - +234 802 474 1100: America is light years ahead of Nigeria btw. That much is clear.

You only enjoy the comparison when waxing lyrical about institutions that took 200yrs to build; happily comparing no holds barred. 

As per giving birth @2348127379568 go tell you my thoughts right from time. But since it is not only my decision; voilà.... No hypocrisy there; if I were a hypocrite, I would have relocated many times over but that’s me @14692437489 but that is besides the point.

Don’t you ask yourselves why news like this made you guys so defensive, cos you know that’s not the whole story of America, but you refuse to accept that the news you read is not the whole story of Nigeria
7/6/21, 18:01 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: No call my name enter ur quarrel plix.
7/6/21, 18:03 - +234 802 474 1100: I just Dey read this one.

I can’t help it if all you see is me trying to prove that the country is doing well.

I have said it before let me say it again. I disagree with your wholesale assessment that the country is failing across ALL indices you have measured (your words); thus my only job here is to open your eyes to the parts where we are making progress. That is all I am doing.

If you feel that the two statements ( 1. Nigeria is failing 2. Nigeria has improved in some areas) cannot coexist; then that’s not my own doing.

I tried to talk about financial services, but No some people talk say na tech, ok tech I accept, another person talk I am myopic and focused on the little things.

Little things like police brutality, discrimination, gun crime, white supremacy, shootings in these developed countries:
7/6/21, 18:04 - +234 802 474 1100: 🥰😍😍😍
7/6/21, 18:04 - +234 802 474 1100: I have finished ✅
7/6/21, 18:13 - +234 802 474 1100: Sorry I have to add one more. 

Have you EVER seen any country that is United as you describe. Except if they were all zombies and been fed from the same news source! 

Every country world over has to contend with varying perspectives of the same country to make progress. To wait until everybody agrees with your version of the country is bad .... hell will freeze over! 

We are a country of diverse people, we will always have these differences; we will always have an imperfect government. The first fallacy is thinking YOU have done all the analysis there is to do
7/6/21, 18:14 - +234 802 474 1100: @2348029717134 no type abeg... I’m done
7/6/21, 18:15 - +234 802 474 1100: 🏃🏾🏃🏾🏃🏾
7/6/21, 18:15 - +234 802 971 7134: We don’t have varying perspectives for progress we have varying perspectives for domination, bringing the other guy down
7/6/21, 18:16 - +234 802 971 7134: The average person doesn’t care what happens to the rest as long as he and his are okay
7/6/21, 18:16 - +234 802 474 1100: I see it as the same actually. That’s how humanity is built. Democrats or Republicans, Britons or Europeans, the Chinese or Hongkong —- there is no altruism, just self interests and their meeting point
7/6/21, 18:16 - +234 802 971 7134: Well their self interests are more encompassing then
7/6/21, 18:17 - +234 802 474 1100: If self interests align, then we have a deal, if not, we continue the chaos
7/6/21, 18:17 - +234 802 971 7134: When was the last time any Nigerian leader had such interests that have benefited people enmasse. Not the whole country just a major chunk?
7/6/21, 18:20 - +234 802 971 7134: I understand no country or government is perfect but Naija na different breed. The audacity is what kills me. They do these things and throway because they feel nothing will happen and indeed nothing happens for the most part
7/6/21, 18:20 - +234 802 971 7134: We learn to live with it cos who wan die? Shebi as long as there’s life there’s hope
7/6/21, 18:20 - +234 802 971 7134: Na e go better we don Dey sing since. Voice don crack
7/6/21, 18:23 - +234 802 474 1100: I agree that the situation is bad! I honestly do!

I’m just asking that we, to use the American anecdote, watch both CNN and Fox News. Not a great metaphor but I hope someone will not be picky to focus on the appropriateness of the metaphor.

And with that possibly a balanced view.
7/6/21, 18:24 - +234 802 971 7134: So what’s the Nigerian version of Fox News pls?
7/6/21, 18:24 - +234 802 971 7134: NTA?
7/6/21, 18:24 - +234 803 075 0650: When death is big business http://chrisakor.blogspot.com/2015/12/when-death-is-big-business.html

@2348024741100 calm down.  We've been writing about the ills of western societies too since time immemorial. So calm down
7/6/21, 18:24 - +234 802 474 1100: The one you are watch already na 😂
7/6/21, 18:24 - +234 802 474 1100: Nice one!
7/6/21, 18:24 - +234 802 971 7134: Na you be Fox?
7/6/21, 18:24 - +234 802 474 1100: 😂
7/6/21, 18:25 - +234 802 971 7134: Bro naija story don pass balanced view o
7/6/21, 18:25 - +234 802 971 7134: I talk to my folks I talk to my friends people Dey suffer people Dey fear
7/6/21, 18:25 - +234 802 971 7134: It’s not about being one sided it’s about the realities
7/6/21, 18:26 - +234 802 971 7134: If I do waec get 7 F9 with 1B and 1A Wetin be that
7/6/21, 18:27 - +234 802 971 7134: No be say na even maths I pass. Not something core Yoruba and some weird subject
7/6/21, 18:27 - +234 802 971 7134: How do you spin that Fox or not?
7/6/21, 18:33 - +234 802 474 1100: No spinning! The results based on social media appear bad. WAEC insists they did not see a massive change in pass rates. 

I think that clearly there would be an impact of COVID and 2020 on education for a country that does couldn’t have reached all its students in lockdown through technology
7/6/21, 18:34 - +234 802 474 1100: Anyone doing the analysis would expect the impact of last year on pass rates and education in general - so I’m not sure about lumping it in there as another reason Nigeria is failing
7/6/21, 18:46 - +234 803 075 0650: But you know Nigeria has the highest number of out of school children in the world abi  at 13 million even before the pandemic?
7/6/21, 18:48 - +234 802 474 1100: Of course.
7/6/21, 18:49 - +234 803 075 0650: And you know we're also the poverty capital of the world too abi?
7/6/21, 18:49 - +234 802 474 1100: But on this topic in response to Cy, those 13million did not write WAEC na... i was simply helping provide clarity on his WAEC anecdote
7/6/21, 18:50 - +234 802 474 1100: Yea sir we are. Highest no of people below the poverty line
7/6/21, 19:05 - +234 803 075 0650: No. Not just poverty line, EXTREME poverty
7/6/21, 19:06 - +234 803 075 0650: And you know we have the 4th worst maternal and infant mortality rate in the world too abi?
7/6/21, 19:06 - +234 803 075 0650: So you won't blame @2348127379568 for wanting to have her kids in a same place. It's not your life on the line🤪
7/6/21, 19:07 - +234 802 474 1100: Oh great not the worst then.

Btw, you know what happens to those indices if you look at them regionally right? Not to cause an argument here. Just a probing question
7/6/21, 19:08 - +234 802 474 1100: P.S first line was a joke... we have to clarify these days, as e no Dey transmit well over WhatsApp
7/6/21, 19:09 - +234 802 474 1100: All the indices btw, when you assess regionally? The results are starkly different - Again, this is not a defense of anything, just a little qualification of the data
7/6/21, 19:11 - +234 803 072 5702: Bros, I assure you that the reason you are looking for “balanced view” is that you have not been adversely affected in anyway - you have a roof over your head and you have enough to provide for your family for years to come, no member of your family has been killed or kidnapped, neither do you live in constant fear of bandits attacking your house, no family land of yours has been overrun by herdsmen, your sources of income have not been adversely impacted by crappy policies…
Just thank God for your situation and leave matter. Will you ask any of the mothers whose babies were kidnapped yesterday…or the parents of the 140 students kidnapped from the Baptist school for “balanced view”?
So ope ti e…
7/6/21, 19:17 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Beht this waec thing was an analogy shey? Abi na me no read am well? 🤔
7/6/21, 19:20 - +234 802 971 7134: Eugene I was talking figuratively using waec o
7/6/21, 19:20 - +234 802 971 7134: My angle is sometimes no matter the side you look from e bad
7/6/21, 19:21 - +234 802 474 1100: Not true bro. Not true at all!

I honestly don’t like to give personal examples, doesn’t just work for me. I kept my dads death from COVID from most people cos it turns out that’s just how I am.... We buried popsy a few weeks ago. Na here be the first place wey I Dey talk am. He still had a pulse in the ambulance that took over an hour to arrive because of traffic.
Was in the village with my village people and all, I see! I have family members impacted etc.

My dads younger brother is based in Maiduguri. Our hearts are in our mouths. I’ve got team members based in Kaduna and Kano for whom I was responsible for.

So my perspective I would say is not based on a lack of awareness/personal experience. I have seen the worst of poverty personally, living and growing up in Bariga! In the slums! Trust me man! Leave the butter wey you Dey see now, I don see suffer
7/6/21, 19:21 - +234 802 971 7134: Naija Dey that category
7/6/21, 19:22 - +234 802 474 1100: And again I am not saying that Nigeria is doing well! There are things we are terrible at. But there are also things we are doing well at, regardless of the government in power
7/6/21, 19:24 - +234 802 971 7134: But those things we are doing well are a drop in the ocean of the ones we are woeful at
7/6/21, 19:25 - +234 802 474 1100: Ok. My bad! There is news on social media right now about how poor the results are - 

Just imagine say na my response to that one 😀
7/6/21, 19:26 - +234 802 474 1100: Just may well be as you say.

All I’m asking is if we understand better how we are doing something’s well, it may unlock the secrets for how to do other things better
7/6/21, 19:58 - +234 802 474 1100: <Media omitted>

7/6/21, 19:59 - +234 802 474 1100: This source of data is one I would typically quote, as it’s open source ... but heck you get my drift
7/6/21, 19:59 - +234 802 474 1100: Is not one*
7/6/21, 20:57 - +234 803 072 5702: Sorry about your Dad. May he Rest In Peace🙏🏿
7/6/21, 21:01 - +234 803 075 0650: Amen!!!
7/6/21, 21:11 - +234 802 474 1100: Amen
7/6/21, 21:31 - Dee: Gotta ask. How do they come by all these figures they are quoting ?
7/6/21, 21:41 - +234 803 075 0650: They're publicly available data.
7/7/21, 04:45 - Dee: I understand that. I mean they say it like Nigeria or some international organization actually conducted the census or questionnaire to get this figures. 

I have never been counted in any census or given a questionnaire to answer  question. And this is true for many people to. 

So it makes me think these figures are estimates, based on a small sample they conducted the research. Not actual figures.
7/7/21, 06:20 - +234 802 474 1100: True. The accuracy of these figures are not exactly there. But  I guess we make do with what we have. Especially cos of the political lens that a census is looked at
7/7/21, 20:59 - +234 803 072 5702: @14692437489 hope Elsa is not saying hi in your area tonight o?
7/7/21, 21:57 - Kenneth Maths. US.: No, she is not close to us at the moment! Thanks for checking bro.

Na the season we de so till October
7/7/21, 22:00 - +234 803 072 5702: Thank God
7/7/21, 22:28 - Kenneth Maths. US.: You can never count or give everybody a questionnaire. It makes sense "statistically" to do some random sampling (hopefully they are really random) which is a representation of the actual population
7/7/21, 22:30 - Kenneth Maths. US.: So @2348126296642 we don't need to count u or need u to answer the questionnaire to be correct😅
7/7/21, 22:30 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Yes o👍🏼
7/8/21, 06:09 - Dee: Yes I agree but it calls the accuracy into question sort of. 

If I sample 20 people from ajegunle or mushing, chances are 90% will be living below the poverty line. 

If i sample 20 people from ikoyi, chances are 90% will be living above the poverty line. 

We don't know how the sample was taken. And looking at how the first world media almost always shows people in leaves dancing with sticks, ( like the zulu of SA) when profiling africa or show those fishermen when talking about lagos, it is not too much of a stretch to assume the sample didn't cover the right places. 

I mean, some first world media puts the air quality of lagos way below China's own. China that was using face masks many years before Covid, cos of the air pollution there.  

I mean, you go out everyday and get stuck in traffic, super expensive cars everywhere around you. 

You go to the airport and you can't get a place to sit cos it is full. 

Went to the cargo side of the airport yesterday, and the standing was almost shoulder to shoulder. This is an area that is bigger then the entire ICM in 


There is almost no time I go out and don't ask myself, "where are these people getting these money?" 

So yeah, honestly I get what you are saying about the sampling. I do. That is simple statistics. And yes, I know Nigeria isn't as rich as come countries. And the small money we are even getting sef, some people are using it to do "dorime".  

But I do wonder sometimes if these things we hear about Africa in general, is intentionally manipulated to suit a particular narrative?
7/8/21, 07:10 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Captaaaaaain 

....we don't know how the samples were taken..." When people like you are too educated *(which is very good)* and will not stay on their own chosen area (lane) of specilization, we will always have issues of not trusting the data or science that is not in our domain.

Keyword is *radom* and like i said "...hopefully they are random".
7/8/21, 07:11 - Dee: 😀 weyrey
7/8/21, 07:11 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Colleague e😅
7/8/21, 07:13 - Benedict: Thank you o. Deji is questioning the entire fields of Mathematics and Statistics because he doesn't agree with the results. 😁
7/8/21, 07:15 - +234 802 474 1100: Bros... 
please educate us o! How were the samples taken? 👁🚶🏿
7/8/21, 07:15 - Dee: 😀I did maths too na. So i understand what you guys are saying. But we don't know how they took the sample. What i know is what i see. And sometimes, e no dey jell.
7/8/21, 07:16 - Kenneth Maths. US.: I do not know. If you read carefully, i said *hopefully*. So don't jump into conclusions and say it is wrong when you yourself don't know or cannot disprove it
7/8/21, 07:17 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Na werey🤣
I wee question the elicopta he flies now and how terrible everything is
7/8/21, 07:17 - +234 802 474 1100: Me I have not said it is wrong.

I’m simply joining @2348126296642 to question it na
7/8/21, 07:18 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Don't question what you don't have claims/facts about is what i am saying. Simple
7/8/21, 07:19 - +234 802 474 1100: Haa lobatan - that is everything in life na... is it question before you gaan find answer ni...
7/8/21, 07:19 - +234 802 474 1100: Is it not question*
7/8/21, 07:19 - +234 802 474 1100: 😜
7/8/21, 07:22 - Kenneth Maths. US.: There is a difference between *asking questions* to *know more* and *questioning* the *authenticity* of what you *don't know*
7/8/21, 07:23 - +234 802 474 1100: Touché 😀
7/8/21, 07:23 - +234 802 474 1100: Fait point...
Oya @2348126296642 you need to change 😎
7/8/21, 07:30 - Dee: 😀 oya na. I will gladly explain it to the very last bolt. The one I don't know, I will tell you I no know. 

I trust statistics. I trust math. But we also know statistics especially, when used in a misleading way, can give whatever result you chose to make it give and misleading people. 

We just don't know how it was taken. So we can't assume it is accurate either.
7/8/21, 07:31 - Dee: *mislead
7/8/21, 07:33 - Benedict: I know u studied maths and your wife statistics that's why I responded. 😁
7/8/21, 07:34 - Dee: 😀 for where? I didn't invent the oxymoron "trust but verify" na.   I just use it.
7/8/21, 07:35 - Kenneth Maths. US.: I just don't trust what you fly cos i don't know how much of what you learnt is true or how much of what u learnt you are actually using.
Let's not just trust anything in this world
7/8/21, 07:36 - Kenneth Maths. US.: 🤷🏽‍♂️
7/8/21, 07:36 - +234 802 474 1100: But that’s why the authorities verify his flight skills regularly
7/8/21, 07:36 - Dee: See? 😁😁
7/8/21, 07:36 - Dee: 🤣🤣🤣🤣 oya take bus next time u r coming to Nigeria.
7/8/21, 07:36 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Authorities? How fo we know,@2348126296642 did not bribe them or his way?
7/8/21, 07:37 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Walahi i will walk sef🤣🤣🤣
7/8/21, 07:39 - Dee: E for sweet o. If to say u fit bribe collect license. All these nonsense 6 monthly trips to westpalm won't be necessary. I will just be lounging at home every time off.
7/8/21, 07:40 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Well na only u sabi, i am just questioning the validity....simple 🤣🤣
7/8/21, 07:40 - Benedict: But wait o, is @2348126296642 doubting that we have that many poor people in naija?🤔
7/8/21, 07:44 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Is the sample size a true representation of the population?

How randomly were the samples taken?

If there are clusters with specific peculiarities which are a far cry from others...does the sample have representations from all clusters?

Poor sampling can lead to misleading results. 


I dont know wht you guys are talking about o...na the statistics part I dey talk about generally.

Good morning👩🏼‍🦯👩🏼‍🦯👩🏼‍🦯👩🏼‍🦯👩🏼‍🦯👩🏼‍🦯👩🏼‍🦯👩🏼‍🦯👩🏼‍🦯
7/8/21, 07:44 - Kenneth Maths. US.: No he is not. He is only doubting how they got there....which to me is synonymous
7/8/21, 07:45 - Kenneth Maths. US.: 😅🤣
7/8/21, 07:45 - +234 802 474 1100: <Media omitted>
7/8/21, 07:45 - Dee: Oh not at all. I really got to know how poor people were, during the early periods of the covid lockdown. Honestly, I it was an eye opener. And I even believe I don't know bad it really is. 

What I am saying is there are some things u watch about Africa and some statistics about Nigeria, u wonder if you are living someone where else.
7/8/21, 07:45 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Summarize
7/8/21, 07:45 - +234 802 474 1100: Oya someone should study it and report back
7/8/21, 07:45 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Summary pls
7/8/21, 07:45 - +234 802 474 1100: I dinor read it o... @14692437489 can help us
7/8/21, 07:45 - Bootylicious Honeypie: The way you said this sef...🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
7/8/21, 07:46 - Kenneth Maths. US.: E be like say u nor see say i de ask for summary too🤣🤣🤣
7/8/21, 07:46 - +234 802 474 1100: Them Dey talk things wey I no understand... I see plenty dy/dx that one na your domain
7/8/21, 07:53 - Dee: E no synonymous anything o. It is different. 

For example,I  cannot believe China has a better air quality that lagos. How na? 

They fly CAT 3 approaches, right down to the runway with zero vis, to some of their airports sometimes, due to to bad visibility, caused by pollution.

Their citizens have been wearing masks loooooooong before covid. Pure air in cylinders, is a booming business in china. 

So how can a place like that have better air quality that lagos? 

But watch some of these first world media post air quality updates, and you will see china's own better than lagos. 

Its isn't their fault. It is the statistics they have to display. They didn't conduct the research. Just using it. 

So yeah, we can't trust all the statistics cos we can't know how it was carried out or the motive behind it.
7/8/21, 07:54 - +234 802 474 1100: They probably sampled only port harcourt 😀
7/8/21, 07:55 - Kenneth Maths. US.: <Media omitted>
7/8/21, 07:56 - +234 802 474 1100: <Media omitted>
7/8/21, 07:57 - Kenneth Maths. US.: I have not read it, but how can we trust what is there?😅🤣
7/8/21, 07:58 - Kenneth Maths. US.: See me messing my lyf with those that have slept and are awake already running their day activities
7/8/21, 07:58 - +234 802 474 1100: Thunder  🌩
7/8/21, 08:02 - Dee: 😀😀If they had said PH, I would have believed it a bit more. Cos that place ehn? God help them. 

But na lagos dem put there o.
7/8/21, 08:06 - Dee: 😀😀 we have turned you to doubting Thomas. But that is how it should be. That is science. Doubt everything until there is enough data to reasonably conclude that it is accurate.
7/8/21, 08:10 - Dee: 😀 no na. It is the sampling i am questioning o.
7/8/21, 08:10 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Ehen na, i don't trust anything again too😅

Also, see why i wee not trust u flying me? Cos u will be doubting all the data in the world while u fly and be doing research inside cockpit instead of concentrating. 🤣🤣🤣
7/8/21, 08:14 - Benedict: Maybe I have a reasonable level of trust in the data cos I know a little about the data gathering process.
7/8/21, 08:15 - Benedict: There are organisations in Nigeria and abroad that all they do is gathering this data and they are sponsored by various bodies. Faith works freelance for some of these organisations
7/8/21, 08:19 - Benedict: And I know what they go through to get the data and sometimes the data gets rejected or questioned based on it failing some statistical quality checks.
7/8/21, 08:20 - Benedict: And in most cases, the data collector is usually found to have been doing funny stuffs (being a Nigerian)🤦🏾‍♂️
7/8/21, 08:30 - Dee: 😀 you know, even though I have a fully coupled autopilot system, I don't fully relax when flying o. 

I mentally fly the aircraft from take off to landing. Just incase it decides to go crazy. Why did I start doing this? 

I was setting up to land a ship once. Aircraft fully coupled. On the downwind leg. 

Without warning, the aircraft pitched nose up, banked right and turned right. This was 500ft off the sea level. 

I decoupled the autopilot with lightning speed and landed it. I flew the entire way back to shore manually. 

So now, I watch the autopilot like a hawk. Most pilots do actually. Those things can be temperamental sometimes. It is just bunch of lines of codes after all.
7/8/21, 08:32 - Dee: Like what do they do?
7/8/21, 08:32 - Dee: I mean the funny stuffs
7/8/21, 08:36 - Benedict: Lols. Some people sit in their houses and manufacture data.
7/8/21, 08:36 - Benedict: So the company installed GPS trackers on the tabs that are used to input the data
7/8/21, 08:37 - Benedict: Then some started walking around randomly 😂😂
7/8/21, 08:37 - Benedict: So they started validating GPS locations against the expected location
7/8/21, 08:37 - Dee: 😀 chai
7/8/21, 08:38 - Benedict: Then they started going to the location but would walk around without interviewing anybody
7/8/21, 08:38 - Benedict: Then the company started recording audio of their interviews
7/8/21, 08:38 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Well we know of planes that have crashed due to pilots not "flying mentally flying the aircraft from take off to landing", so don't use ur how many times of flying mentally to bobo me. At least one case is sufficient for me not to trust u and the entire syst. Finish....😝
7/8/21, 08:38 - Dee: 🤣🤣 rather than just do the damm job.
7/8/21, 08:39 - Kenneth Maths. US.: See better person.....chai Benedict can say this😅
7/8/21, 08:39 - Benedict: As in. I don't get. Some of these enumerators put in so much effort to beat the system. Like 🤦🏾‍♂️
7/8/21, 08:39 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Lol...you better trek when next you are coming to Nigeria
7/8/21, 08:40 - Benedict: Now they do the data gathering twice
7/8/21, 08:40 - Dee: 😀😀 you better start walking now. You should reach here by December
7/8/21, 08:40 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Walahi with what Captian has said this morning, i am cancelling my ticket and wee start trekkingby the end of the month🤣
7/8/21, 08:41 - Benedict: 1st time is the proper one then the 2nd time as back checking the 1st survey
7/8/21, 08:41 - Benedict: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
7/8/21, 08:41 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Correct! At least you can trust your legs...but how you wan take navigate? You fit trust GPS so?
7/8/21, 08:42 - Kenneth Maths. US.: See system that works! @2348030750650 pls comman write about this (onr good thing in 9ja)😅
7/8/21, 08:42 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Hope the second one is not forged too😁😁😁😁😁
7/8/21, 08:42 - Dee: And even that can't guarantee people won't still walk around to beat GPS locators. 

I guess they find the average of  both sets of data collected right?
7/8/21, 08:42 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Do they use a different set if enumerators for the second one?
7/8/21, 08:43 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Ehen, that gps sef is another thing....

I wee just join my village people, those ones sure die once dem take off for night and na seconds we go take arrive
7/8/21, 08:44 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Hehehehehehehehe...superb navigation.
7/8/21, 08:44 - Benedict: Of course. Usually more experienced and "trusted" ones
7/8/21, 08:44 - Benedict: After all these they run all the statistical analysis on the data o.
7/8/21, 08:45 - Benedict: To see the enumerators that have found ways to beat the ssytem
7/8/21, 08:45 - Kenneth Maths. US.: To interview the *same set of people*?
7/8/21, 08:45 - Benedict: And they don't pay the enumerators until they have validated that their data is good
7/8/21, 08:45 - Benedict: Yeah.
7/8/21, 08:46 - Benedict: Usually a shorter interview to validate the previous responses
7/8/21, 08:46 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Okay that is good but i think, waste of resources
7/8/21, 08:46 - Dee: 😀😀 if you know what pilots don't tell you ehn, you will never fly again. As long as it is safe for passengers, the flight will continue. 

Like if a pilot announces on radio that they lost one hydraulic system, the second one is operating very well, but the aircraft cannot fly if the other one shuts down as well, will you have a restful flight? So no they won't tell you. Cos they believe the second one will do that job well. 

And if it fails, well,......
7/8/21, 08:46 - Benedict: U can't blame them o. Naija people don show them shege
7/8/21, 08:47 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Some people will not travel again after reading this o...hmmmmmm🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
7/8/21, 08:48 - Kenneth Maths. US.: @2348024741100 U see, he exposing all the distrust we are talking about.
7/8/21, 08:48 - Dee: 😀😀 village people no know where Nepa pole dey o. Risk dey dia too. You fit land now to find high tension wire between your legs.
7/8/21, 08:48 - Kenneth Maths. US.: ....and @2348024741100 flies very often o
7/8/21, 08:48 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Its not distrust nah.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
7/8/21, 08:48 - Kenneth Maths. US.: 😁
7/8/21, 08:49 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Dem no give you wrong information
7/8/21, 08:49 - Dee: 😀😀. You know every already
7/8/21, 08:49 - Kenneth Maths. US.: That between ur legs though🤣🤣🤣
E go bad o😁
7/8/21, 08:49 - Bootylicious Honeypie: They just don't make you worry unnecessarily.  So you don't die of heart attack before the main crash🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
7/8/21, 08:50 - Benedict: We have to just trust some things o. If we distrust everything, we will be living in fear all our lives.
7/8/21, 08:50 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Lol@mainCrash🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
7/8/21, 08:51 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Tell captain @2348126296642  and Abidjan @2348024741100 o😅
7/8/21, 08:52 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Ok wait o....all this energy we put talking about all these things ehn, we would have used it to plan one trip to hang out since o🤔
7/8/21, 08:52 - Dee: 😀 we don't lie na. We just don't tell you stuffs, until it physically moves the plane or you see the effect. To keep your blood pressure in the green. 

The cargo hold could catch fire and the pilot won't tell you about it, as long as the smoke doesn't reach the cabin.  They will just quietly put it off and continue the flight.
7/8/21, 08:53 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Ah!

Since the day you told me the take offs and landings are the most dangerous parts...hmmmm
7/8/21, 08:54 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Don't be saying all these things o. I know how my head over calculates things when I fly...giving myself headache by wondering what could be wrong that the pilot isn't sayinb
7/8/21, 08:54 - Benedict: Knowledge is really a curse as Thanos said. After reading Airframe, a novel many years back, I always fly in fear.
7/8/21, 08:54 - Dee: 🤣🤣 u can visualize it bah? Experiencing compassionate pain for the cojones already?
7/8/21, 08:54 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Ignorance in this case is bliss o
7/8/21, 08:55 - Dee: We don't distrust everything na. Just some things that contradict what we are seeing.
7/8/21, 08:55 - Benedict: The plane literally crashed cos some maintenance guy used expired rivets to fix the wing slats
7/8/21, 08:56 - Benedict: I was skeptical until I saw that the book was based on a real life event.
7/8/21, 08:57 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Also why I don't like to watch Air Crash Investigations
7/8/21, 08:57 - Dee: 😀😀 u be veteran na. Nothing suppose dey shake u again.
7/8/21, 08:57 - Dee: 😀😀
7/8/21, 08:57 - Bootylicious Honeypie: Hmmm...ignorance is bliss o. You know how my imagination works...
7/8/21, 08:57 - Benedict: Now I try to get wing seats cos they are said to be the safest and I can literally see the f**king thing hold us up there.
7/8/21, 08:58 - Bootylicious Honeypie: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
7/8/21, 08:58 - Dee: Every single part of a plane or helicopter has a time before overhaul (TBO). basically when it has to be replaced. It is when these are not done that bad things happen.
7/8/21, 08:59 - Dee: True sha. Ignorance can be bliss.
7/8/21, 08:59 - Benedict: Exactly what happened. The rivets had reached the manufacturer's maximum number of hours and the technician made a judgement call that they were still fine for that trip
7/8/21, 09:01 - Kenneth Maths. US.: <Media omitted>
7/8/21, 09:08 - Dee: Actually, the safest place on a plane and the last couple of seats at the very back. Close to the tail. 

That tail section is one complete unit. And it is strong. If a plane comes apart in flight, that section comes off as a complete unit, with the chairs intact. 

Also your best bet of surviving a plane crash. Cos when a plane crash lands, usually, they go in front first, cos the pilot will be trying to land it. The front absorbs the impact and it dissipates the force as the rest of the body absorbs the impact. By the time it gets to you at the back, it would have come to a stop. 

This is the reason why pilot almost never survive a bad crash landing. But some passengers do. 

So next time someone feels  big buying first class tickets, tell them they have a higher chance of dying, if the plane crashes. 😁
7/8/21, 09:09 - Dee: You deleted this message
7/8/21, 09:14 - Dee: Ouch. That person probably went to jail
7/8/21, 09:17 - Benedict: Really? Lols.
7/8/21, 09:21 - Dee: Yeah. But that over wing seats are the most comfy when riding turbulence. The back seats are the worst. Cos u feel the effects more the further back or front you are from the wings. 

So have a smooth flight during turbulence, with a lower chance of surviving an accident , or a rougher flight during turbulence,  with a higher chance of surviving an accident. 😀
7/8/21, 09:23 - Benedict: Well, considering how rare plane crashes are and how common turbulence is, I'll take my chances on the wings. And watching them gives me a little sense of control. 🙈
7/8/21, 09:24 - Benedict: It's like sitting in the front passenger seat of a car. You don't have the controls but u feel like you know what's happening.
7/8/21, 09:24 - Benedict: 😂😂
7/8/21, 09:26 - Dee: 😀 correct!! But considering I don't have a choice but to fly relatively often, I always carry my ass jejely to the very last seat on the plane if available. Every single time.
7/8/21, 09:26 - Dee: 😀😀 so true
7/8/21, 09:30 - +234 802 474 1100: This is a script for a movie o... Bros don’t scare me off flying Biko
7/8/21, 09:34 - Dee: 😀😀 don't worry, air travel is "statistically" the safest means of travel there is. I trust this one.
7/8/21, 09:59 - +234 803 072 5702: …this is apparently one of the bandits’ demands…

7/8/21, 10:05 - Bootylicious Honeypie: So you feel like it's your own wings bah?🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
7/8/21, 10:05 - +234 803 075 0650: You're vomplaining? Well, everybody in Nigeria Is a professor of political science. We have jaundiced opinion on everything even once that have been settled empirically for hundreds of years.

7/8/21, 10:09 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Chris aff wake up😁
7/8/21, 10:09 - Dee: If it is going to be an actual school, that teach all required subjects with some Islamic activities, ( Just like catholic schools with good academics and some christian teachings), then it isn't a bad idea. 

They can buy TV in their houses, if they have time to watch it.
7/8/21, 10:10 - +234 803 072 5702: People’s private businesses? Haba!
7/8/21, 10:11 - Dee: Oh they are private businesses ?
7/8/21, 10:12 - Kenneth Maths. US.: They should fix the debilitating one first abeg.....I hear their "schools " are nothimg to write home about (i don't know the numbers o)
7/8/21, 10:12 - +234 803 072 5702: Govt nor dey get viewing centre na
7/8/21, 10:13 - Dee: You are probably correct. Served in kotorokoshi in zamfara and their schools there are not even close to standard.
7/8/21, 10:14 - Kenneth Maths. US.: @2348030725702 
“Some of the viewing centres were abandoned and had become refuse dumps, criminal hideouts and places where redundant youths hang around, to plan and commit crimes.”
7/8/21, 10:14 - Kenneth Maths. US.: According to the post
7/8/21, 10:14 - Dee: You know the way they run things in the north is different. I assumed since they want to convert it, then they must own it.
7/8/21, 10:15 - +234 803 075 0650: Can Abiy Ahmed prevent the disintegration of Ethiopia?

Christopher Akor

Two weeks ago, I wrote about how Abiy Ahmed, the young, fresh-faced Ethiopian Prime Minister went from winning a Nobel Peace Prize to becoming a war monger within the space of eleven (11) months. I argued that the Norwegian Nobel Committee was fooled by Abiy’s rapprochement with the Eritrean dictator, Isaias Afwerki, thinking the move was for genuine peace for the people of Ethiopia and Eritrea. In reality though the rapprochement was just to isolate and hem in the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) on all sides. On November 4, while the attention of the world was focused on the US, Abiy, in collaboration with Eritrean troops launched a brutal military war on Tigray to topple the TPLF and suppress the Tigrayan people whose elite has governed Ethiopia for more than 30 years but willingly handed over power to Abiy, an ethnic Oromo, in a spirit of national reconciliation. To give cover to the troops and enable their atrocities, Abiy ordered electricity and all communications and internet services to be cut in Tigray and prevented all journalists and humanitarian workers access to the region.
Of course, before long, credible accusations of massacres, ethnic cleansing, extrajudicial killings, widespread looting and rape, food blockade, stoppage of all farming activities including ploughing, planting, or harvesting and the killing of livestock and looting of farm equipments began surfacing. It was clear the Ethiopian troops and their Eritrean collaborators are not just determined to brutally suppress Tigray, but also deliberately instigate a famine and use starvation as a weapon of war.
However, what I did not see coming two weeks ago was the stunning reversal of fortunes in the battlefield. In fact, due to the media and communications blackout of the region, no one expected it. After all, Mr Abiy had said upon launching the military operation that it would last only for about two weeks. Then, barely a month later, he declared victory but said Ethiopian troops were engaged in mop up operations to root out all the remaining Tigrayan fighters hiding in the mountains. But the few reports emanating from the region indicate that fighting has continued in the region since then.
Then last Monday, out of the blues, Mr Abiy declared a unilateral ceasefire. According to him, it was for humanitarian reasons and to allow crops to be planted. But the lie was exposed when remnants of Ethiopian troops quickly abandoned the region, pausing, as The Economist puts it, “only to dismantle telecommunications equipment and raid a UN office.” Other accounts say they also raided and emptied the banks and food stocks from the few aid agencies that had been allowed into the region. The ceasefire was apparently an effort to mask the defeat of its troops and allow them to retreat.
After the gains made by Ethiopian troops in the first few weeks of the fighting, aided by Eritrean troops and fighter jets, the Tigray Defence Forces (TDF), took to the hills, just like their grandfathers (in the successful insurgency against the Derg communist dictator of the 1980s) and their fathers before them (in the two years border war with Eritrea). The resistance gathered strength and many more Tigrays joined the rebellion as the atrocities committed by the Ethiopian and Eritrean troops became known. Even opponents of the TPLF quickly joined the TDF guerrillas since they knew they faced torture and murder if caught by Ethiopian troops. In a way, they were fighting for their lives and their survival as an ethnic group. The desperation by Abiy and Afwerki to conquer the region by sheer cruelty equally resulted in a determined, disciplined and unusually courageous fight-back Ethiopian and Eritrean troops were neither prepared for nor expected.
In two weeks of fierce fighting in June and led by very determined and highly skilled military veterans, the TDF inflicted one of the worst defeats ever suffered by the Ethiopian armed forces. The TDF killed, captured or put out of action more than half of Ethiopia’s army’s combat capabilities. It annihilated five full army divisions on June 22 and repeated the same feat on three more reinforcement divisions sent in by Abiy shortly after. Eritrean troops have since withdrawn from the towns they occupied and if the TDF makes good on its pledge to march to Asmara, the Eritrean capital, Afwerki is unlikely to survive a second war with the TPLF.
To confirm the total route of Ethiopian troops, the TDF, on Friday, July 2, paraded over 6000 captured Ethiopian prisoners of war through the regional capital.
Also, since Ethiopia pulled out of the Mekelle, the region has experienced electricity, telecommunications and internet blackouts. A key bridge providing access over the Takeze River was also destroyed by retreating Eritrean troops and Amhara Special Forces, key allies of Mr Abiy. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said on Friday that getting aid into Tigray is now “more difficult” – and all the difficulties (engineered by Ethiopian troops and its allies) are not signs of a humanitarian cease-fire, “but of a siege”.
This stunning victory by the TPLF has changed projections in the regions. If the Ethiopian government continues to blockade Tigray, the TDF, energised by the capture of most Ethiopian weaponry and with its morale very high, could decide to fight to break the blockade to access the Sudanese border or even toppling Isaias Afwerki, the Eritrean dictator.
Much more consequential is the popular sentiments for secession in Tigray. With the initiative now firmly in the hands of TDF and with Abiy’s determination to continue to blockade the region, secession cannot be ruled out. Also, if the TPLF declares independence, it may spell the end to Ethiopia’s fragile ethnic federation, just like Yugoslavia’s. This is besides the border skirmishes with Sudan and the looming threat of war with Sudan and Egypt over the filling of the massive hydropower dam on the Nile. With Abiy’s bellicosity, it’s difficult to see how he can keep Ethiopia united and prevent a war with his neighbours.
While the United Nations is frantically trying to bring the warring parties to the negotiation table, the African Union has predictably ruled itself out as an impartial arbiter by its unflinching support for Abiy’s aggression.  
7/8/21, 10:16 - Benedict: This guy is why I am believe Nobel peace price should be post humous like Canonization
7/8/21, 10:16 - +234 803 072 5702: Saw that. Why won’t dey be abandoned when the people are afraid that ontop going to watch ManU vs Arsenal, dem fit pass there die? Happy
7/8/21, 10:17 - +234 803 072 5702: Still doesn’t justify annexing dem for Islamic schools.
7/8/21, 10:21 - Dee: Any reason why the African region is supporting Abiy?
7/8/21, 10:22 - Benedict: Probably cos most African countries have a region that wants to break out
7/8/21, 10:23 - +234 803 075 0650: The African union is like it's predecessor, OAU, a dictators club. Leaders support one another no matter the crimes they commit
7/8/21, 10:23 - Dee: Oh I see what you mean
7/8/21, 10:24 - +234 803 075 0650: See how Kenya abducted and illegally repatriated Nnamdi Kanu to Nigeria? These guys will support one another.
7/8/21, 10:24 - +234 803 075 0650: No matter the crimes they're committing
7/8/21, 11:40 - +234 802 474 1100: Bros... Me i would have repatriated the guy myself. Illegally or otherwise. I don’t like it when people have messianic delusions.
7/8/21, 11:49 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀 who did I marry? Illegally is never an option, unless it’s to process passport or visa!
7/8/21, 12:53 - +234 803 075 0650: Well now your Buhari can't go to the UK for his medical treatment. The UK is demanding explanations.
7/8/21, 13:39 - Dee: With "oyel" that we have that UK is coveting? Na dem go send am private plane to carry him to the UK sef. Then make noise in front of the press to appease the rest of the world.
7/8/21, 13:39 - +234 803 075 0650: What rubbish oil? Check the buyers of Nigerian oil. The UK is not one of them
7/8/21, 13:44 - Dee: They buy from us too actually. But their main country is Norway.
7/8/21, 13:54 - +234 803 075 0650: You seem to be living in a different era o. Oil that is yapa everywhere with sellers looking for buyers daily.

7/8/21, 14:00 - Dee: Yes I agree it is yapa everywhere  and Nigeria and some OPEC members had to cut production and reduce price at some point.  But they still buy. Infact, as at late 2019, before COVID, we were among top 10 countires UK buys from.
7/8/21, 14:04 - Dee: Ok this article is recent. so maybe this is the current situations of things.
7/8/21, 14:18 - +234 802 474 1100: Chris. You see why I Dey sometimes attack you small. You have chosen this ONE data point to conclude that oil is yapa every where.

Meanwhile multiple data points exist like oil price is at an all year high, oil futures are also forecast to continue to rise, the article points to a specific contract with IOC (but was sold as Nigeria struggling to sell its oil), OPEX forecasts a 6% oil demand growth in 2021 and many other data points that would at least lessen your conviction that « oil is yapa everywhere and sellers are looking for buyers)
7/8/21, 14:18 - +234 802 474 1100: I come in peace ☮️ 😜
7/8/21, 14:31 - +234 803 075 0650: Yes, oil price is at $77 for a reason - severe production cut by OPEC. That cut isn't sustainable. Besides, lower oil prices puts shell gas out of the market. Now they're roaring back. 
Besides, Europe has set a deadline for the total stoppage of production of petrol cars.
7/8/21, 18:16 - +234 802 474 1100: All of the events you mention have been captured in the oil futures....

But here’s my point again: the single story, headline grabbing, click bait type of articles. It is polarizing. There should be a declaration that it is an opinion piece and not a news article anymore.

This article now: the writer took one situation where a force majeure on the part of the buyer caused the contract not to be honored and put a headline « Nigeria struggling to find buyers for her oil ». 

People then share the headlines because they are too lazy to check the details. Nigeria can’t sell her oil; Bleak future for Nigeria’s revenue, 60% poverty rate etc...
7/8/21, 18:17 - +234 802 474 1100: With this few points of mine.... 😥
7/8/21, 18:18 - +234 803 075 0650: This guy I'm here arguing with is making his cool money in Cote D'ivoire o. Abeg let me go and face my baby and train her well o jare😏

7/15/21, 12:13 - +234 803 075 0650: Africa cannot innovate its way out of bad governance

Christopher Akor

A fortnight ago, I discussed the leadership problem in Africa. I argued that even as African economies were failing in the 1960s and 70s, issues of growth and development were largely seen as politically neutral or even above politics and all that was required was the influx of foreign investment and implementation of public sector reforms. It was not until the failure of the Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs) imposed on African countries that the attention began to turn to leadership and governance.
Still, there was an obvious refusal to engage with governments. Governments across the continent were seen as corrupt and part of the problem. Following the spate of state failures and worsening socio-economic conditions in Africa in the 1980s, Western donors and civil society tried to circumvent the state by intervening directly to provide vital help to people and communities. From the mid 1980s there was a proliferation of Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) providing social welfare services, economic empowerment, humanitarian services, and human capital development. For instance, while Ghana had only ten registered non-profit NGOs in 1960, the figure had risen to 350 in 1991, and by 2001, it had ballooned to 1300. Ditto in Tanzania. In 1992, there were only about 200 registered NGOs but rose to 813 two years later, and by 2001, the number had swollen to between 1800 to 8000. Most development assistance were funnelled through these organisations.
Many of these NGOs – both local and international -have long ceased to exist and the extent of their impact is doubtful. What is not in doubt however is that even when they were in operation, socio-economic conditions continued to worsen across the continent even as donor fatigue became a problem. In fact, with hindsight, countries that received the most aid became substantially poorer.
 
One key lesson from that episode, besides the issue of sustainability of NGOs, is that there is as yet no alternative to governments. Governments are indispensable to building a successful and prosperous society. Every successful and prosperous society needs a capable state that, in the words of Ricardo Hausmann, “can protect the country and its people, keep the peace, enforce rules and contracts, provide infrastructure and social services, regulate economic activities, credibly enter into inter-temporal obligations, and tax society to pay for it all.” Unfortunately, government, by nature, is a monopoly; so there can’t be an alternative.
 
 
After decades of under-performance, African economies began recording healthy growth at the turn of the 21st century thanks, in no small part, to the boom in commodity prices and the implementation of some liberal reform policies. In Nigeria, for example, the liberalisation of the economy enabled the private sector to blossom to such an extent it could challenge the state for the control of the commanding heights of the economy. The once dominant oil and gas sector’s contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) started to decline precipitously, climbing down from a high of 48.9 percent in 1999 to a low of 2.8 percent in 2016 and now stands at only 8 percent.
 
The liberalisation of African economies and the growth of the private sector resurrected the thinking that again, we could circumvent the government and that the private sector, through entrepreneurship, market-creating innovation and the deployment of technology could lead the charge to end extreme poverty, unemployment, and environmental degradation and herald an era of prosperity in Africa. This argument posits that the market-creating innovations ultimately pulls in institutions (political, economic and social) and ultimately transforms society’s system and structures for good.
 
However, it didn’t take long for the Buhari administration in Nigeria to prove this new iteration of the circumvention theory wrong again. Upon coming to power, his government set about clawing back the commanding heights of the economy from the private sector. While still mouthing pro-market rhetoric, the government has been consistently implementing policies to make it difficult for the private sector, entrepreneurship or market-facing innovation to thrive or even access funding. This is most eloquently seen in the conduct of the central bank’s monetary policy since 2015. In 2017, a former member of the central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and now Chair of Buhari’s Economic Advisory Council (EAC), Doyin Salami. Blowing the whistle at the meeting of the MPC of the CBN in July 2017, Mr Salami expressed “concern over the increasing fiscal deficit .... and crowding out effect of high government borrowing”. In plain language, the terribly compliant CBN has been illegally printing money to fund the government.
 
However, according to Salami, the “massive injections of cash” to the government doesn’t reflect in higher inflation and currency weakness at the time because the CBN through “special auctions” raised the cash reserve requirements for banks beyond the stipulated 22.5 percent thus skilfully crowding out the private sector.  “We thus find ourselves at a point where government borrowing from the CBN is neutralised by raising the CRR of banks, thereby limiting private-sector access to credit”, said Salami who later lamented that “Monetary policy management is presently about funding the federal government.” 
 
Although the CBN has raised the official CRR ratio in Nigeria to 27.5 percent, the actual CRR rate is between 58 to 60 percent. The CBN, as at 2020, held as much as N10.3 trillion in CRR out of a total naira deposit of N17 trillion. Coincidentally, the N10.3 trillion the CBN is illegally holding is also about the size of the federal government’s budget.
This is besides the shambolic handling of the forex regime, the crippling business environment, failing and decrepit infrastructure, inability to keep the peace, respect contract, lawlessness and insecurity in the country that has stifled most entrepreneurship, innovation and businesses.
Any wonder then that the economy has tanked, foreign and local investments have dried up, borrowings have skyrocketed (total debt stock as at March 2021 stood at N107 trillion ($87. 239 billion), unemployment and inflation are on rampage and Nigeria continues to languish at the bottom of the world poverty and most development indexes.
The private sector and prosperity paradox advocates must realise that the role of the private sector is, at best, complementary to that of the government and bad governments can and do dismantle the private sector and put a stop to entrepreneurship and innovation when they threaten their control of the society. There is as yet, no alternative to good governance in the crafting of a successful and prosperous society. No wonder Francis Fukuyama opined that the development of a capable state that is accountable and ruled by law is the crowning achievements of human civilisation. As desirable and indispensable as the private sector is, our most immediate need in Africa is the creation of a capable state that is accountable. That is the only way we can banish hunger, diseases and wars and build the Africa of our dreams.

7/17/21, 09:01 - +234 803 075 0650: @2348024741100 as always you fail to see the most important thing. Inflation in the UK is less than 1% and part of the goal of the quantitative easing is to hit an inflation goal of 2%. Besides, government will pay back all the money being created.
In Nigeria however, Inflation officially at 18%. What is more, with revenue to debt service ratio at 97%, there's absolutely no way the government is paying back the debt. It's free money.
7/17/21, 09:02 - +234 802 474 1100: Lol… you don start 😀

Did I show you what I saw? How did you see that I did not see the important thing? 😃😃😂?
7/17/21, 09:04 - +234 802 474 1100: Up to the extent that I always fail to see the important thing, because it is not what you see😃
7/17/21, 09:05 - +234 803 075 0650: No. By trying to draw an equivalence between QE in Nigeria and QE in UK, EU or the US. There's absolutely no basis for comparison
7/17/21, 09:06 - +234 802 474 1100: Exactly. In Nigeria it’s called illegal money printing by you! In the UK and US its QE…

You make my point quite nicely
7/17/21, 09:07 - +234 802 474 1100: Abeg @2348029717134 come and stop us o
7/17/21, 09:07 - +234 803 075 0650: Yes, because in the UK, EU and US it follows the law. There's a law in Nigeria but it doesn't follow it. The law is clear: 5% of government revenue
7/17/21, 09:07 - +234 803 075 0650: You always start these arguments 🤪
7/17/21, 09:08 - +234 802 474 1100: 😂😂🤣
7/17/21, 09:08 - +234 803 075 0650: Besides while those governments will pay back, in Nigeria there's no paying back. It's free money
7/17/21, 09:08 - +234 802 474 1100: Great way to leave an argument on a high…

The person who says « you too Dey argue » feels better😀
7/17/21, 09:14 - +234 802 474 1100: Check out the ratio of Debt to Revenue ratio for these countries - UK, US and Nigeria… and come back…

P.S i haven’t checked, but I suspect two things … The ratios aren’t particularly different and two, they should actually be widely apart because as a growing nation Nigeria should be spending way more building infrastructure
7/17/21, 09:17 - +234 803 075 0650: And stifling and killing the private sector abi? There's just no defending illegal printing of money. Zimbabwe, Venezuela are stirring at us.
7/17/21, 09:18 - +234 802 474 1100: Yea there is that risk of the impact of corruption but that’s a second argument. Quite different from the stark need to spend your way to growth…

7/29/21, 10:25 - +234 803 075 0650: Yes. Obama also refused to sell arms to Jonathan forcing him to get arms through the back door. And APC were cheering Obama then and encouraging him not to. 
The principle Obama applied then is what is called the Leahy law - that forbids the selling of US arms to countries that violates human rights. The only problem is that the US never applies the law to Saudi Arabia.
Trump doesn't care about human rights and the arms deal was struck with the Trump admin. Unfortunately, Trump is no longer president

1. How much is the education budget today?
2. Is it an incremental something or gidigba?
3. More importantly, how is Buhari making plans for a 2025 presidency in 2021?!
7/29/21, 12:19 - +234 803 075 0650: Nigeria's Education budget is slightly over $1billion shekere. 
As for the other questions, I have no answer. Maybe @2348024741100 does
7/29/21, 12:38 - +234 802 474 1100: Again headline baiting!

Thé actual plan is a progressive growth that shows how the budget for education will rise annually!


A pledge by leaders across the world not just Nigeria. But again smart people - read Nigerians only do headlines and enjoy the bashing 😏😏
I honestly don’t know why I continue to do this, but if you have ONLY read a headline can you just not draw a conclusion. It would make conversations actually more valuable.
7/29/21, 12:39 - +234 802 474 1100: Good questions! But the answers are actually out in the open!

7/29/21, 12:42 - +234 803 075 0650: @2348024741100 this is a former deputy governor of CBN crying fowl like us too🤪
7/29/21, 12:44 - +234 802 474 1100: I am looking for the joke here
7/29/21, 12:46 - +234 802 474 1100: Nice article Chris…

But I will challenge you to read the WHOLE article …

According to him, experience has shown that the banks are no more efficient than the BDCs in the foreign market.

He said; “This kind of move will only work when we have a much better system in place and we know that now we have multiple exchange rates. This move by CBN will only create a non-transparent system with artificial shortages and manipulation of the system. For me, it is like taking from one cartel and giving to another. We have not really been told at what rate the banks are to operate. Is it at a free market rate or at a guided rate? If that is not official, then we are creating a much more bigger black market.”

 

The former CBN Deputy Governor made comparisons with other countries and highlighted that the CBN has no business continuously funding BDCs.

He cited countries like South Africa as a shining example of where banks are strictly in charge of foreign exchange market.

“If you look at the United Kingdom, the USA and most of the countries of Europe, banks and BDCs work together but I don’t believe that the Central Banks of those countries are in the business of doling out billions of dollars to the BDCs, even though the banks could help them at the initial stages. I don’t think that is how things work,” he said.

Mailafia highlighted three main issues he believes, the CBN would need to address in stabilizing the Naira, and proffered solutions.

He predicted that if the CBN is able to properly manage the frivolous demand for dollars by Nigerians, it might be possible to make an advantage of the situation.

“The issue as far as I am concerned is firstly, the transparency of the whole foreign exchange market.

“Secondly, is the lack of long-term strategic planning for the naira and thirdly, the problem of dollarization of the economy,” he said.

*While noting that dollar may rise against the naira, Mailafia said if the situation is managed well and frivolous purchasers of foreign exchange who just want to buy and keep, are discouraged, it will help rationalize the system.*
7/29/21, 12:46 - +234 802 474 1100: I highlight the concluding paragraphs
7/29/21, 12:47 - +234 802 474 1100: And the ones preceding it
7/29/21, 12:48 - +234 802 474 1100: This isn’t someone crying foul, but someone adding more points to how to strengthen the actions in my opinion..

Thé sensational paragraph about Cabals unfortunately becomes a headline
7/29/21, 12:50 - +234 803 075 0650: If..... We know how it always ends up🤪
7/29/21, 12:51 - +234 802 474 1100: He cited countries like South Africa as a shining example of where banks are strictly in charge of foreign exchange market.

☝🏾 This is an actual line from the article you shared!!!! 

Contrast it with the headline
7/29/21, 12:53 - +234 802 474 1100: But we don’t!!! This is the same problem with voter apathy!! Barely anyone turned up for LGA elections. Even in a group of well educated people! The refrain was « we know how it ends up »
7/29/21, 13:19 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Bros, i asked a question on the headline and did not draw any conclusion. You still remember what *"?"* stand for right? I have them in my comment.

7/29/21, 15:14 - +234 803 075 0650: Aid and the hollowing out of a country’s institution: Lessons from Haiti

Christopher Akor

On January 12, 2010, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit Haiti, killing an estimated 230, 000 people, injuring another 300, 000, displacing more than 1.5 million people and virtually destroying critical infrastructure in the country. Conservative estimates of the damages put the cost at $7.8 billion representing about 120 percent of Haiti’s GDP at the time.

As expected, humanitarian aid flooded Haiti from governments, multilateral and private aid agencies. Over $13.5 billion of aid was donated in 11 years since the disaster. Expectedly, the massive injections robbed the Haitian government of legitimacy, destroyed its already weak institutions, destroyed many local businesses and generally distorted the local economy by pushing up wages, rents and prices.

To begin with, most of the donors did not trust the Haitian government or state and constantly bypassed it in the administration of the aid. They brought in  foreign agencies and contractors to administer the aid, creating parallel governments and structures with zero accountability. Shortly after, in October of 2010, the Head of the United Nations mission in Haiti, Edmond Mulet, admitted the damage they were doing to Haiti by bypassing the government to administer aid directly. “We created this Republic of NGOs, almost 10, 000…And we have created parallel structures, in education, in health services, in all sorts of responsibilities that the Haitians should be assuming themselves.”

The magnitude and destruction wrought by the earthquake and the fact that it destroyed nearly two-thirds of hospitals in affected areas led to a massive influx of doctors, nurses and medicines from outside.  Before long, local doctors and hospitals lost all their patients and with free drugs everywhere, most pharmacies too shut down. Local doctors, nurses and pharmacies were either absorbed by the coterie of agencies or contractors or became unemployed. The consequences for the country after the aid dried up was devastating.

Ditto for the agricultural sector. The massive influx of free foreign food upended local agriculture, cutting prices and driving farmers out of the farms. To make matters worse, the US used the aid programme to expand its export of rice to Haiti. Haiti was America’s third largest export market for rice. And with American policy of ban on direct assistance to industries that compete with American exports, the local agriculture industry suffered while American rice, poultry and sugar importers made a killing.

Truth is, the international community only specialises in offering emergency aid and have no specialty or even interest in transitioning from emergency to long-term development for affected countries. What happens is that countries and organisations providing the aid position their companies and personnel to be the biggest beneficiaries of the aid programme.

What ends up happening is that the aid programme creates a system based on NGOs and contractors that keeps the country artificially alive and doesn’t give the government any incentive to undertake necessary reforms. Predictably, the recipient country begins to retrogress and decay the moment the aid programme ceases and always finds itself in a worse place. With Haiti, all assessment shows that virtually all state institutions were hollowed out and were in a worse shape than before the aid.

Of course, one cannot also discount the influence of corrupt politicians and nepotistic elites who cash-in on the misfortunes of their countries to enrich themselves, entrench and secure their various selfish positions.

After more than 200 years of struggling with foreign interferences and foreign-installed or sponsored dictators, Haiti was gradually and successfully navigating the democracy curve with a series of successful democratic elections before the earthquake struck in 2010 and every progress was reversed.

President Jovenel Moïse came to power in 2017 on the back of a contested election that saw only 18 percent voter turnout. He casts himself as a populist leader that is fighting for Haitians against the oligarchy that is running Haiti, but as is often the case, these populist leaders do the most damage to their countries. In 2019, an internal government investigation found that millions of dollars of aid money had disappeared under Moise’s watch. There was no investigation and no accountability. The country has been wracked by protests since.

Worse, President Moise despised all institutions of accountability and set about dismantling all government institutions that competed for power with him. In 2020, Parliament’s term expired and he refused to call an election. He’s basically been ruling as a dictator since then.

President Moïse was also embroiled in a huge political dispute with the opposition over the expiration of his term in office. On February 6, the Supreme Court ruled that Moïse’s term had ended that day, counting the president’s five-year term from 2016. The next day, one of the judges was arrested and jailed for conspiring against the government. The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights described the arrest and detention as “unlawful and arbitrary.” Not done, on February 8, three justices of the Supreme Court were sacked and three new judges were appointed without following procedures established in the constitution.

The next month, Moise announced plans to write an entirely new constitution that will restructure the country and give the presidency new and greater powers. Interestingly, he handpicked all members of the constitution drafting committee without any input from anyone else.

All these were happening as the economy was crumbling. According to some estimates, some 60 percent of Haitians are unemployed, half of the country is facing severe malnutrition and kidnapping and crime are becoming the only business available to many people.

The hollowing out of Haiti’s institutions finally caught up with president Moise. On July 7, about 50 gunmen stormed Moise’s house at the outskirts of the capital, Port-au-Prince, shouting ‘D.E.A, D.E.A’ (American Drug Enforcement), walked passed the hundreds of presidential guards there without firing a single shot, entered Moise’s bedroom, shot him to death, injured his wife, walked out and left the scene without a single shot being fired by the guards.

This hospital makes business sense. If Nigerians spend $5billion yearly on medical tourism, situating it in Nigeria will give them a slice f that money. Simple!!!!

7/30/21, 17:19 - +234 802 474 1100: And on the 99% part… you know you can’t say that and still expressly agree that it makes business sense to situate larger hospitals in Nigeria… one has to give

8/16/21, 10:01 - +234 802 474 1100: ALL STORIES MATTER, EVEN TOUGH ONES


In the first half of 2021, African tech startups raised $1.9 billion in funding with at least $100m monthly. This already beats the 2020 figure of $701.5 million that was raised in spite of the pandemic, and the year isn’t over yet!

Of the $1 billion in 2022, fintechs brought in 48% of it. 

This is a good thing, right? It means that more investors are interested in what we offer, it means more value, and a brighter future, right? Well, it is but perhaps it's also a call to action.

Okay, okay, where is this coming from?

From these Economist and Financial Times articles. 

In July, both publications released two articles that have been the source of a heated debate online. 

Both articles examined the state of fintech in Africa, circling Nigeria particularly. What these articles did do was highlight the concerns many African founders, investors, and key players in the tech space have been saying for years: African [fintech] startups need local investors. 
What they didn’t do? Well, according to Derin Adebayo, a manager at Endeavor Catalyst, there was no objective [or positive] outlook on the matter. Both articles refuse to credit the steady rise of investment in Africa fintech, a number that has steadily risen from $70 million in 2016, to $356 million in 2020. It also deigns to interrogate why the numbers keep rising, why investors keep investing. 

In fact, the Economist’s article uses quotes from prominent investors like Maya Horgan Famodu, Eghosa Omoigui, and Nichole Yembra, to question the sustainability of the system. 

So what’s the problem with this?

There are a lot of factors that de-markets African startups. Local [and international] policies, capital investments, product placement, etc. Pessimism, especially when veiled in highly-read publications like the Economist and Financial Times, shouldn't be a part of it. 

The sustainability questions raised in the articles are valid but the tone is disconcerting.


In his rebuttal, Derin Adebayo, criticizes the intent of the articles. “These aren’t new facts,” he says. “I struggle to believe there is anyone investing in Nigeria’s fintech ecosystem that would be shocked to hear any of this. So if there is over-exuberance in the market, it is certainly not due to ignorance of these factors.”

All stories matter

Victoria Crandall doesn’t agree with Adebayo though. 

Crandall, who is a PR Strategist, explains that critical media is not the enemy. In her article, she highlights that all stories, including those that interrogate apparent success and numbers, shouldn’t be dismissed as they are equally important to the growth of the African tech ecosystem. 

“There is a better way,” Crandall says. “African tech startups and investors shouldn’t dismiss credible journalism or shy away from the media, fearful of hit pieces. They should engage more with journalists to get their messages out and influence the conversation on African tech.”

Cherry-picked comments


Maya Horgan Famodu, founder of Ingressive Capital, whose quote in the Economist’s piece earned her a bit of backlash, isn’t going to be misquoted. The Economist had portrayed Famodu as an investor who was concerned that the influx of foreign investors in Nigerian fintechs would cause the market to “overcorrect.”

Famodu, has however, explained that her comment, a small bit from an hour long conversation on sustainability, was cherry-picked to suit the article. 

Zoom out: There are at least two sides to every story. To truly understand narratives, it's important to consider all sides, even those that might make us uncomfortable. As Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie said, "Stories can break the dignity of a people, but stories can also repair that broken dignity."

So what do you think? Which perspective do you support?

1. Not cause me any health condition or put me in any risk whatsoever at all
2. Then make thwm say i can't travel but the family with negative result can go.

It was looking like that when they sent madams result sunday morning and my own did not come until i made over 20 calls that day and it came in negative at night😌

8/24/21, 17:41 - Kenneth Maths. US.: To show to the wife that one really wants to go back, hence they will be sympathetic with you should  the result be positive and things qork out ur way

People like Kenneth are not paying for the various foods we are exporting to the US. Thus our exchange rate, thus the impact on the economy. Thus and I put it to you, @14692437489 is directly responsible for the weak naira… 

I rest my case 🚴🚴🚴

8/25/21, 13:48 - +234 803 075 0650: Haba @2348030725702, according to @2348024741100, they are building a world class hospital in Lekki🤪🤪🤪
8/25/21, 13:48 - Kenneth Maths. US.: This one that @2348024741100 has been typing for about an hour now like so
8/25/21, 13:50 - +234 803 075 0650: He was trying to reply @2348030725702. But now wey I don comment, he has to pause to tackle me first🤪
8/25/21, 13:51 - +234 802 474 1100: Amen to the prayer.

Pay for healthcare workers is really poor. I do have classmates for whom their salary is crap. Similar to the choice people in all other sectors are making - people are making the personal choice to go where they are better remunerated.

The Kenya govt recently mooted an idea where they’ll even collaborate with the UK govt to « export » some of their nurses and health care workers.

Covid has made it even more so that Richer countries have made the recruitments more overt. Thé UK fasttracks visa for doctors, same as the US, Canada and Europe.

The other side of the equation is what Nigeria and other Low and Middle Income countries can do to retain talent in the face of the active recruitment. 

Related to this @2348030725702 is the question of capability to treat diseases: we have the capacity. Oncology treatments recently got included in various insurance plans. My own team and colleagues have been working on this for about 8yrs now. The same policy work is ongoing in various disease areas.

Unfortunately as I have said earlier: Echo chambers are dangerous: they don’t help make any progress. If you want me to simply echo what many people already say about how bad everything is. I can do that. I used to do that. But I have worked with people who despite the challenges are making progress and I choose to identify with the half full glass.
8/25/21, 13:52 - +234 802 474 1100: Lol… me i don gree say na echo chamber you want. You no wan engage. Unfortunately I can’t offer that 😀
8/25/21, 13:57 - +234 802 474 1100: One last part is this:

If you ask some people who only see the various medical errors in our hospitals; they will say Nigerian doctors are the worst.

But they also turn a blind eye to what an active recruitment of Nigerian Helth Talent means: it means that we are training quite good doctors. I have colleagues who pass various American and European exams quite handily leveraging the training in our « terrible » schools
8/25/21, 13:58 - +234 803 075 0650: In fact, our schools are the best🤣🤣🤣🤣
8/25/21, 14:00 - +234 802 474 1100: Lol. Funny!

But it isn’t a dichotomy : Good or bad!
8/25/21, 14:07 - +234 803 075 0650: I've now decided to be your echo chamber o. A proverb in my Idoma language says "agree with what the Reverend Father I saying so that the mass can end".

8/26/21, 11:46 - +234 802 474 1100: Good morning Vacationers
https://nairametrics.com/2021/08/26/nigerias-gdp-grows-further-by-5-01-in-q2-2021/
8/26/21, 11:50 - Dee: On other words, good job non oil sector. But the rest of us that are oil slaves one way or the other, should get out of the oil sector and look for plan B.
8/26/21, 11:56 - +234 802 474 1100: Yeah fair conclusion I would say.

But like I tell my younger brother, Ernest. It wouldn’t be a hurry per se, there is the long term clarity that the world will make a shift from oil. But from a career perspective(short/medium term), except there is a shake up within his own firm, then no need to rush out
8/26/21, 11:57 - +234 802 474 1100: But for the broader conversation. The non oil sector growth is good news as diversification continues.

Even though govt revenue still has a long way to go
8/26/21, 11:58 - Dee: I get that. But it takes time to be proficient in a new field and gain required experience right? So maybe now is the time to start plotting and planning
8/26/21, 11:59 - Dee: Yeah it is good news. We depend on oil way too much. Maybe we will look elsewhere more now.
8/26/21, 12:01 - +234 802 474 1100: True sha! 🧐

Maryann went through this earlier. She should have more insight sha
8/26/21, 14:05 - Maryann Onuegbu (NFCS): Since them mention my name…
‘Is going through this’ is closer to the truth

Definitely, plotting and planning is the way to go. With any change, there is a transition period. How long that transition may be is anyone’s guess. Some people double down on the legacy end, some people move with the transition (learning new skills step by step, diversifying) and some do a very sharp pivot outside of their comfort zone. 

In my experience, honest plotting and planning will help with the decision
8/26/21, 14:09 - Dee: 👍🏽

Now, we're being forced to celebrate 5% one quarter growth as real success. 👏👏👏

8/28/21, 17:07 - +234 803 075 0650: Africa cannot innovate its way out of bad governance

Christopher Akor

A fortnight ago, I discussed the leadership problem in Africa. I argued that even as African economies were failing in the 1960s and 70s, issues of growth and development were largely seen as politically neutral or even above politics and all that was required was the influx of foreign investment and implementation of public sector reforms. It was not until the failure of the Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs) imposed on African countries that the attention began to turn to leadership and governance.

Still, there was an obvious refusal to engage with governments. Governments across the continent were seen as corrupt and part of the problem. Following the spate of state failures and worsening socio-economic conditions in Africa in the 1980s, Western donors and civil society tried to circumvent the state by intervening directly to provide vital help to people and communities. From the mid 1980s there was a proliferation of Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) providing social welfare services, economic empowerment, humanitarian services, and human capital development. For instance, while Ghana had only ten registered non-profit NGOs in 1960, the figure had risen to 350 in 1991, and by 2001, it had ballooned to 1300. Ditto in Tanzania. In 1992, there were only about 200 registered NGOs but rose to 813 two years later, and by 2001, the number had swollen to between 1800 to 8000. Most development assistance were funnelled through these organisations.

Many of these NGOs – both local and international -have long ceased to exist and the extent of their impact is doubtful. What is not in doubt however is that even when they were in operation, socio-economic conditions continued to worsen across the continent even as donor fatigue became a problem. In fact, with hindsight, countries that received the most aid became substantially poorer.

 

One key lesson from that episode, besides the issue of sustainability of NGOs, is that there is as yet no alternative to governments. Governments are indispensable to building a successful and prosperous society. Every successful and prosperous society needs a capable state that, in the words of Ricardo Hausmann, “can protect the country and its people, keep the peace, enforce rules and contracts, provide infrastructure and social services, regulate economic activities, credibly enter into inter-temporal obligations, and tax society to pay for it all.” Unfortunately, government, by nature, is a monopoly; so there can’t be an alternative.

 

 

After decades of under-performance, African economies began recording healthy growth at the turn of the 21st century thanks, in no small part, to the boom in commodity prices and the implementation of some liberal reform policies. In Nigeria, for example, the liberalisation of the economy enabled the private sector to blossom to such an extent it could challenge the state for the control of the commanding heights of the economy. The once dominant oil and gas sector’s contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) started to decline precipitously, climbing down from a high of 48.9 percent in 1999 to a low of 2.8 percent in 2016 and now stands at only 8 percent.

 

The liberalisation of African economies and the growth of the private sector resurrected the thinking that again, we could circumvent the government and that the private sector, through entrepreneurship, market-creating innovation and the deployment of technology could lead the charge to end extreme poverty, unemployment, and environmental degradation and herald an era of prosperity in Africa. This argument posits that the market-creating innovations ultimately pulls in institutions (political, economic and social) and ultimately transforms society’s system and structures for good.

 

However, it didn’t take long for the Buhari administration in Nigeria to prove this new iteration of the circumvention theory wrong again. Upon coming to power, his government set about clawing back the commanding heights of the economy from the private sector. While still mouthing pro-market rhetoric, the government has been consistently implementing policies to make it difficult for the private sector, entrepreneurship or market-facing innovation to thrive or even access funding. This is most eloquently seen in the conduct of the central bank’s monetary policy since 2015. In 2017, a former member of the central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and now Chair of Buhari’s Economic Advisory Council (EAC), Doyin Salami. Blowing the whistle at the meeting of the MPC of the CBN in July 2017, Mr Salami expressed “concern over the increasing fiscal deficit .... and crowding out effect of high government borrowing”. In plain language, the terribly compliant CBN has been illegally printing money to fund the government.

 

However, according to Salami, the “massive injections of cash” to the government doesn’t reflect in higher inflation and currency weakness at the time because the CBN through “special auctions” raised the cash reserve requirements for banks beyond the stipulated 22.5 percent thus skilfully crowding out the private sector.  “We thus find ourselves at a point where government borrowing from the CBN is neutralised by raising the CRR of banks, thereby limiting private-sector access to credit”, said Salami who later lamented that “Monetary policy management is presently about funding the federal government.” 

 

Although the CBN has raised the official CRR ratio in Nigeria to 27.5 percent, the actual CRR rate is between 58 to 60 percent. The CBN, as at 2020, held as much as N10.3 trillion in CRR out of a total naira deposit of N17 trillion. Coincidentally, the N10.3 trillion the CBN is illegally holding is also about the size of the federal government’s budget.

This is besides the shambolic handling of the forex regime, the crippling business environment, failing and decrepit infrastructure, inability to keep the peace, respect contract, lawlessness and insecurity in the country that has stifled most entrepreneurship, innovation and businesses.

Any wonder then that the economy has tanked, foreign and local investments have dried up, borrowings have skyrocketed (total debt stock as at March 2021 stood at N107 trillion ($87. 239 billion), unemployment and inflation are on rampage and Nigeria continues to languish at the bottom of the world poverty and most development indexes.

The private sector and prosperity paradox advocates must realise that the role of the private sector is, at best, complementary to that of the government and bad governments can and do dismantle the private sector and put a stop to entrepreneurship and innovation when they threaten their control of the society. There is as yet, no alternative to good governance in the crafting of a successful and prosperous society. No wonder Francis Fukuyama opined that the development of a capable state that is accountable and ruled by law is the crowning achievements of human civilisation. As desirable and indispensable as the private sector is, our most immediate need in Africa is the creation of a capable state that is accountable. That is the only way we can banish hunger, diseases and wars and build the Africa of our dreams.

8/28/21, 17:22 - +234 802 474 1100: Lol… it’s not humble jare…

If it were humble, you would have since considered that there are perspectives out there that can enrich yours 😀… and not remain set in your ways 😂😂

On the flip side, that would apply to me as well. 🤧😜

But heck I get participation points for considering it 😅
8/28/21, 17:38 - +234 803 075 0650: Sorry I get work to do🤨
8/28/21, 18:51 - Dee: I will legit dedicate my life to Christ, the day Eugene and Chris agree on everything for 24hrs.
8/28/21, 18:53 - +234 803 075 0650: then no heaven for you be that. @2348024741100  will even oppose my thoughts.
8/28/21, 18:55 - Dee: I am waiting for Eugene to disagree with this statement. Which means, there may be heaven for me.
8/28/21, 18:57 - Dee: Without having to dedicate my life to christ. Since he is disagreeing with the statement in the first place.
8/28/21, 19:14 - +234 802 474 1100: Now I’m confused as to which statement to disagree with 😀
8/28/21, 19:19 - Dee: 😀 whichever one you agree to, will help my spiritual life. 

If you agree with Chris. And continue to agree with Chris for 24, I will dedicate my life to Christ. Which helps my spiritual life. Even though you are agreeing with Chris that I cannot make heaven cos you two will never agree on anything. 

If you disagree with Chris  statement that I cannot make heaven, then there is a chance I may make heaven. Even though  you are disagreeing with Chris. Which means I wont be dedicating my life to Christ.

9/2/21, 14:17 - +234 803 075 0650: The problem of accountability in Nigeria?

Christopher Akor

Last week I found myself reflecting on the aberration that is Nigerian democracy. We all agree that Nigeria returned to democratic rule in 1999 and has successfully had four different civilian administrations at a stretch. What is more, it has even peacefully transitioned from one political party to another. That, in some democracy scholarly parlance, is one of the prerequisites for being regarded as an entrenched democracy.

However, like I have always argued, Nigeria and African countries under pressure to democratise the society and liberalise the economy have mastered the art of isomorphic mimicry – what Ricardo Hausman describes as the creation of institutions that act in ways to make themselves “look like institutions in other places that are perceived as legitimate”, but which in reality are not. We can have the best anti-corruption laws on paper, like Uganda, but also be among the most corrupt countries in the world. We could have constitutions guaranteeing freedoms of speech, of the press, of association etc, but in practice be under a repressive state where none of these rights can be exercised. We are just good at quickly stripping institutions of their meanings and turning them into caricatures once they collide with our selfish interests.

In like manner, we have completely stripped democracy of virtually all its meaning save the dry, periodic conduct of elections that are neither free nor fair. For instance, there’s broad agreement by Democracy scholars that modern political democracy, as defined by Schmitter and Karl in 1991, “is a system of governance in which rulers are held accountable for their actions in the public realm by citizens, acting indirectly through the competition and cooperation of their elected representatives.” The question that comes to mind: are Nigerian rulers accountable to their citizens or can their citizens through their representatives in parliament hold their rulers to account?  

As a rule, Nigerian chief executives – president, governors or even local government chairmen – see themselves as imperial lords and are not subject to or accountable to anyone, not even the citizens from whom they claim to derive their legitimacy. They often see the push for accountability even by equal and co-ordinate branches of government as an affront and they move quickly to eliminate or neutralise the threat(s). That is why, for instance, every incoming president or state governor moves to ensure that only his ‘boys’ or loyalists are elected to the leadership of the national or state assemblies.  The lack of accountability in the states is even worse. State governors, in the words of former president Obasanjo, are “emperors” and lords of their states. They brook no dissent or answer to anyone. Speakership and leadership of the state assemblies are ‘jobs for the boys’ and if for any reason the state governor is removed by the Supreme Court (who have now replaced the people and electoral commission as the final arbiters of who won and lost elections) the speaker of the state assembly promptly resigns or is impeached to give way for the new governor’s boy to assume the position.

While Nigerian leaders are generally experts at claiming credit even for the air the citizens breathe, as a rule, they accept no responsibility for anything that goes wrong. Our leaders rather see responsibility like Abrose Bierce, the American satirical writer, as “a detachable burden easily shifted to the shoulders of God, fate, fortune, luck or one’s neighbour.” Bierce said in the days of astrology it was even customary to unload it upon a star. This perfectly describes Nigeria. For instance, while former president Obasanjo will gleefully take credit for single-handedly picking the late Yar’Adua and Jonathan to be president and vice president in 2007, he would vehemently refuse to accept any responsibility for foisting a known terminally ill person on Nigerians that led to a constitutional crisis that ended only with Yar’Adua’s eventual death.

President Buhari also spent the better part of his first term of four years blaming just anyone and everything under heaven except himself for the state of the country and the economy. Even now with the country virtually collapsing all around him, with kidnappers, terrorist insurgents and criminals virtually holding the country to ransom, he would accept no responsibility for the situation in the country. He is, in his words, “doing my best”.

Just last week, he moved quickly to claim credit for the 5 percent quarterly growth of the Nigerian economy – the first such growth since 2014. But in 2018 when the same National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released a record unemployment figure, the Statistician General of the country, Yemi Kale, according to Buhari’s spokesman Garba Shehu, was summoned and the president ordered him “to change the high unemployment statistics. When Mr Kale wouldn’t budge, the president instead set up a new Economic Advisory Council (EAC) and in his inaugural address, admonished them to help produce regime-friendly data to highlight the gains of his administration. The government since then began ignoring all the unemployment and growth figures Mr Kale’s agency periodically put out until last week when he rushed to claim credit for the 5 percent growth announced.

But it is not only our leaders that do not accept responsibility or render account of their stewardship. The culture of lack of accountability and refusal to take responsibility is firmly rooted in Nigerian society. After all, is the leadership not a reflection of the society? Last year, Dellibe Onyeama, a Nigerian writer, was willing to travel to England to accept an apology from Eton College over the racist treatment he received while a student there in the 1960s. but the same Onyeama, whose grandfather was a major slave trader in precolonial Nigeria and whose family’s wealth and privileges are directly tied to the inhuman trade in people, was not willing to apologise for his family’s role in the inhuman trade.

"My grandfather had no rudiments of any form of education at all and he knew nothing beyond the 'kill or be killed' way of life in those days," Onyeama said in justifying his decision not to apologise for his family’s crimes. But he was willing to travel all the way to England on Eton’s bill, to accept a moot apology from Eton’s principal for the attitudes of fellow students in the 60s who didn’t know better!

Come to think of it, when has anyone resigned or accepted responsibility for anything that goes wrong in Nigeria? Yet, no institution, no agency is working, and life is literally becoming like Hobbes' state of nature, nasty, brutish and short.

I mean, you can marry and  have kids with who you don't like or get "physically abused"  constantly to your (dis)pleasure, for whatever reason, but doing all of that just for PR? 

Is it really that worth it?
9/3/21, 12:44 - +234 803 075 0650: That's my world view too but that's if you have options. Some people don't so they are desperate. 
My guy's own is just stupidity. You got a PhD position lasting 5 to 6 years but you're already desperate in the first month. The lady has him where she wants him
9/3/21, 12:46 - Dee: Eiya too bad. He really had options. Now he will pay alimony forever
9/3/21, 12:48 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Captain, there are good stories too. I had a friend whom we went to d same sch, she did runs and in her case the guy she married was deployed out of the country and even b4, he never asked her for anything.

Is it worth it?
Well i will start by saying we are fortunate not to be in situation in which some of those who do such are in.

If ones situation in 9ja is that bad, like i hage some pipu in suchbsituation, i think it is worth it,  they just have to pray to jam d right person

9/3/21, 13:00 - Dee: Honestly, I get the situation thing. Omo, bad situations really can push you to do stuffs you would never do on a normal day.  Just wondering if PR Is such a magical solution to every problem that it is worth all these sacrifices and pain
9/3/21, 13:00 - +234 803 075 0650: But play your game well. Even if you are desperate, don't go about acting with desperation. Fine guy fa!

@2348024741100 what's happening? I thought the blacklisting of BDCs was supposed to be the silver bullet to arrest the slide of the Naira?🤷🏼‍♂️
9/4/21, 07:40 - +234 802 474 1100: It wasn’t supposed to be a silver bullet. It was you who said it would be disastrous…. Like Zimbabwe if I remember correctly.

Good morning
9/4/21, 08:56 - +234 803 075 0650: Now you're going wild, accusing me of what I didn't say.
9/4/21, 08:59 - +234 803 075 0650: Zimbabwe I only mentioned as a note of caution to what stupid use of quantitative easing can do to a currency. It has happened to dozen African currencies by the way, where they keep redenominating every time. It will happen to Nigeria too very soon. Quote me on this
9/4/21, 09:07 - +234 803 075 0650: Check it out, your beloved currency has lost over 700% of its value since 1980 and the loss of value is rapidly accelerating
9/4/21, 09:08 - +234 803 075 0650: In the last 6 years
9/4/21, 09:09 - +234 803 075 0650: That's what abuse of Quantitative easing does to a currency
9/4/21, 09:12 - +234 802 474 1100: We already had a long conversation about this and the short term impact on rates ….

When rates go down you keep quiet 😂😂
When you see rates go up, you start up your talk about quantitative easing and printing of illegal money. Just go back and read earlier chats 

Bring another topic 😀😜😜
9/4/21, 09:16 - +234 803 075 0650: Like when?
9/4/21, 09:19 - +234 802 474 1100: 👆🏿
9/4/21, 09:26 - +234 803 075 0650: When exactly has rates even gone down in Nigeria? We only have stability of rates for a few years at best, say of Naria being 150 to a dollar for like 7 or so years
9/4/21, 09:26 - +234 803 075 0650: Defending the government doesn't mean being ridiculous oga
9/4/21, 09:27 - +234 802 474 1100: This is where you ALWAYs get it wrong. We can have a conversation about economic policy without it being political
9/4/21, 09:28 - +234 802 474 1100: We can talk about support for Nigeria with it being about Buhari
9/4/21, 09:28 - +234 802 474 1100: We can talk about progress in Nigeria or failures without it being about who is in power or the government
9/4/21, 09:28 - +234 802 474 1100: Without*
9/4/21, 09:29 - +234 802 474 1100: 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
9/4/21, 09:29 - +234 803 075 0650: And this is where you always miss it. Every economic decision is political. David Easton defines politics as the authoritative allocation of values (who gets what, when &how)
9/4/21, 09:30 - +234 802 474 1100: Lol… David Easton did not accuse me of supporting Buhari
9/4/21, 09:30 - +234 802 474 1100: 😂
9/4/21, 09:30 - +234 802 474 1100: Because I have a different idea of economic policy
9/4/21, 09:30 - Dee: I know a TV presenter that would love to get the two of you in front of a camera at the same time. The ratings go high gan.
9/4/21, 09:31 - +234 802 474 1100: 😂😂😂
9/4/21, 09:32 - +234 803 075 0650: I won't go on the TV with @2348024741100 o. We can't even agree on terms and concepts. I don't know where he gets his concepts from.
9/4/21, 09:32 - +234 802 474 1100: Chris Dey always drive the bus to reach whether you vote for Buhari or not.

Even in academia there is a reason why Economics and Political science are two different courses. Yes they are entwined but at some point give it a rest na Biko 😀😂
9/4/21, 09:33 - +234 802 474 1100: Like that I support Buhari because I have a certain idea of economic policy? 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
9/4/21, 09:35 - +234 803 075 0650: You don't even know me and the texture of my argument at all. That I don't like this administration, Yes. But my writings are also heavily a critique of the Nigerian state, far beyond Buhari. But he only gets triggered by my criticism of Buhari obviously
9/4/21, 09:37 - +234 802 474 1100: And my own writings are equally about the Nigerian state bros, far beyond Buhari! So maybe you can understand why reducing it to support or lack of, of the government doesn’t cut it.

If you can’t, then that’s just hypocrisy
9/4/21, 09:38 - +234 803 075 0650: where are your writings. I will like to read them. I haven't seen one yet
9/4/21, 09:38 - +234 802 474 1100: 😂😂😂

Take a trip back memory lane on this our “vacation page”
9/4/21, 09:40 - +234 803 075 0650: That is just ventilating on whatsapp. Everybody does that. Put your ideas on paper let's publish it nationally. We can have public debates.
9/4/21, 09:41 - +234 802 474 1100: If you like, you can tag them “responses”, “replies” “counters” to your “writing”.

Lol… thanks I am fine with this page 😂. The regular threat of ejection from Kenneth and Cy keeps it exciting 😂😂😂
9/4/21, 09:43 - +234 803 075 0650: I always challenge my critics to that. Only one person accepted my challenge. And by the time we did just two back and forth, even his supervisor in far away south Africa sided with me and pointed out to him the inconsistencies in his logic
9/4/21, 09:44 - +234 802 474 1100: Oshey!! Superior logic 🤨🤨🤨
9/4/21, 09:44 - +234 803 075 0650: anybody can write anything on whatsapp. Let's go public, let's go national. Stake your reputation let's debate substantial issues.
9/4/21, 09:44 - +234 802 474 1100: Maybe if @2348126296642 gets us that TV slot, I’ll consider it
9/4/21, 09:44 - +234 802 474 1100: Otherwise WhatsApp is a platform as good as any
9/4/21, 09:45 - +234 803 075 0650: TV slots are superficial. Write. I don't take anyone seriously who just argues with mouth. Write. There's no art that forces you to think through your assumptions and prejudices like writing.
9/4/21, 09:48 - +234 802 474 1100: Lol… now that’s just bourgeoisie…
9/4/21, 09:48 - +234 803 075 0650: Now that I've started school, I should have stopped writing, but people keep demanding for my pieces and even BusinessDay keeps insisting I keep writing because people are reading my article and the feedback has been wonderful. If I write rubbish, they'd have kicked me out since. Let me challenge you @2348024741100. Write. Write. Write
9/4/21, 09:48 - +234 803 075 0650: Nothing forces you to think through the inconsistencies in your logic than writing.
9/4/21, 09:49 - +234 803 075 0650: Abeg, make I do my assignments abeg!😏
9/4/21, 09:51 - +234 802 474 1100: Again bro!!! 
Well done with your writing.

A word of caution. Please don’t fall into the temptation of settling on your viewpoint because others agree with you or read and enjoy what you write. 

Do your assignment and like I said, I would consider TV before writing.
9/4/21, 09:53 - +234 803 075 0650: I don't consider you disagreeing with me. I only see it as whatsapp banter until you put pen to paper.  TV slots are very superficial. I will only go on TV with the person I've been engaging with through written words.
9/4/21, 09:55 - +234 802 474 1100: Ah lobatan!

9/5/21, 11:19 - Dee: The intro is powerful, captivating and funny. Especially the part about university mails he tried to sort out. Not sure how they still managed to get that wrong. 

With what he wrote here :- 

.........."Dare you read it?
Dare you face, in one blinding revelation, the reason why schools do not bestow wisdom, why governments cannot maintain order, why courts do not dispense justice, why prosperity fails to produce happiness, why utopian plans never generate utopias? 

Do not decide lightly. The decision to read on is irrevo cable. If you read, you can never regain your present state of blissful ignorance; you will never again unthinkingly ven erate your superiors or dominate your subordinates. Never!
The Peter Principle, once heard, cannot be forgotten. 

What have you to gain by reading on? By conquering in competence in yourself, and by understanding incompetence in others, you can do your own work more easily, gain pro motion and make more money. You can avoid painful ill nesses. You can become a leader of men. You can enjoy your leisure. You can gratify your friends, confound your enemies, impress your children and enrich and revitalize your marriage.
This knowledge, in short, will revolutionize your life— perhaps save it.
So, if you have courage, read on, mark, memorize and apply the Peter Principle".............

It is almost impossible not to continue reading, despite being over 170 pages long.
9/5/21, 11:20 - +234 802 474 1100: It was at that very point that I stopped and decided to share 😀
9/5/21, 11:23 - Dee: Yeah. I just wanted to read the introduction to get a general idea of what it is about. Cos who get time to read 179 pages right? When it is not bringing money. 

But after that introduction, I am definitely reading the entire book.
9/5/21, 11:25 - +234 802 474 1100: Yeah… I typically speed read these types of books… pick things that are interesting and leave the “book fillers”.   Would usually take a couple of hours to “finish” the book
9/5/21, 11:26 - Dee: Oh right. Let's see what secrets this one has got to share.

9/9/21, 16:22 - +234 803 075 0650: She wants the guy, she wants the children, but she doesn't want the guy to get a green card yet. Because she doesn't trust him to stay
9/9/21, 16:23 - Kenneth Maths. US.: How will u not want the father of ur kids to get green card? It means u have the money to take care of all of them, else how does he want to contribute to the family without a job

9/9/21, 16:28 - +234 803 075 0650: the longer he stays the better for her. Keep him on a leash.
9/9/21, 16:29 - +234 803 075 0650: she also doesn't need him working. she can take care of all the bills.
9/9/21, 16:30 - Kenneth Maths. US.: She will lose him if she likes him then
9/9/21, 16:30 - Kenneth Maths. US.: I mean if i am the guy, she will lose me
9/9/21, 16:31 - +234 803 075 0650: that is until he can get his papers na. He also attempted filing for asylum. When lawyers told him their fees, he scrapped the idea
9/9/21, 16:32 - +234 803 075 0650: so he's stucked with her
9/9/21, 16:35 - Benedict: The guy should take it as a win and continue enjoying what he has been enjoying
9/9/21, 16:36 - +234 803 075 0650: Yeah. the moment he finishes his nursing programme, employers will even file for work visa for him. Nurses are hot cakes here na

9/9/21, 16:38 - Benedict: Its a win-win jare 😁

9/9/21, 16:44 - Benedict: lol. its a sacrifice 😂
9/9/21, 18:04 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Not really. He doesn't have to get his papers with her nah....If he has a friend like me, she will lose him if she doesn't file for him
9/9/21, 18:06 - +234 803 075 0650: But she could also make his life miserable with child support too
9/9/21, 18:07 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Child support is based on how much u earn and other responsibilities

9/10/21, 15:44 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: Ok

9/10/21, 15:45 - +234 802 971 7134: That works but you have to play the part

9/10/21, 15:46 - +234 802 971 7134: If na family then religious/political persecution
9/10/21, 15:46 - +234 802 971 7134: But dem go need better evidence sha
9/10/21, 15:47 - +234 803 075 0650: you manufacture evidence na🤪🤪🤪
9/10/21, 15:50 - +234 803 075 0650: You may also need a lawyer to fine tune your case for you. Immigration lawyers charge exorbitant rates

9/13/21, 11:19 - +234 803 072 5702: Let me quickly do this now before i dele back into work. So the Reunion Committee has fixed registration for attendance at 4,000...which is grossly inadequate to cater for all the plans and activities. It was capped at 4k after sampling opinions on what people will be able to play without much hassles.
9/13/21, 11:19 - +234 803 072 5702: *delve
9/13/21, 11:20 - +234 803 072 5702: In summary, there's heavy reliance on freewill donations from kind-hearted individuals to make it a successful one.

9/13/21, 11:25 - +234 803 072 5702: Lol...they have answered her na...i think😁

#indefiniteworkfromhome
9/14/21, 19:01 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Ehen @2348030725702 out of curiosity, if 4k is not enough to cater for each person, why cap it at 4k? Just curious o

9/14/21, 20:22 - +234 803 072 5702: The plan was not to make the amount too high that it’ll be the reason for anyone not too come.  4K seemed a reasonable amount from the few opinions sampled
9/14/21, 20:23 - +234 802 971 7134: Seconded
9/14/21, 20:24 - +234 802 971 7134: This is the same thing as government sponsoring hajj or trip to Jerusalem
9/14/21, 20:25 - +234 803 072 5702: 😂
9/14/21, 20:25 - +234 802 971 7134: I just believe if it’s a reunion it should be pegged at a cost that covers the expenditure
9/14/21, 20:25 - +234 802 971 7134: Or everyone does bring your own food and drink
9/14/21, 20:29 - +234 803 072 5702: That’s what’s reasonable but they said a good number of the Alumni are not gainfully employed or entrepreneured yet…I don’t know any statistics that affirms this sha…it might be true.
9/14/21, 20:30 - +234 802 971 7134: What’s the assurance that even with this fuel subsidy they will still show up and/or not complain/grumble say the rice no get 4 meat?
9/14/21, 20:30 - +234 802 971 7134: Me I just believe whatever you peg it at those wey go show go show

Unfortunately the scarcity of dollars continues - while $20bn sits in the cumulative dorm accounts of Nigerians according to some estimates.

Ironical in my perspective —
9/20/21, 10:19 - +234 802 474 1100: Just over half our foreign reserves
9/20/21, 10:19 - Benedict: Hinting at CBNs next steps
9/20/21, 10:20 - +234 802 474 1100: Nah! That would be endgame
Highly unlikely. Possible but highly unlikely
9/20/21, 10:20 - +234 802 474 1100: That would be like eating your seeds for next years planting season
9/20/21, 10:20 - Benedict: Like Nigeria government think about next year
9/20/21, 10:21 - Benedict: All CBN will do is to ask banks to convert at official rates and credit people's naira account. If you want FX for any transaction, come to bank to buy
9/20/21, 10:22 - Omoluwa Ajala. ng: People wey don mortgage is to China, na seed for planting season be problem? You forget that our collective first reaction to rain is “weather for 2”
9/20/21, 10:23 - +234 802 474 1100: Nah… it’s a fundamental issue with global economics. Can’t happen.

I can’t help but insist on the extremely low probability of this scenario
9/20/21, 10:23 - +234 802 474 1100: Not even worth talking about in my opinion
9/20/21, 10:25 - Benedict: Amen o! Hopefully, abokifx.com stopping the display of exchange rate will bring exchange rate to 1naira to 1 dollar 😁

The fact that you read the article and feel attacked by it is troubling 😀… 

As Smart noted the writer didn’t even take a position. But the reaction from you is telling 😀….
9/20/21, 12:14 - +234 803 075 0650: God forbid that I should feel attacked. My pain is the waste of my precious time
9/20/21, 12:16 - +234 802 474 1100: Pray tell - give a constructive critique of the article.

Mind you: I have no interest in the write up asides from the triggering of conversation and the need to ensure every one has the same view of the facts.

But without your righteous indignation/ purist tantrums, what is your critique of this article that has been a monumental waste of your time (read life 😀😂)
9/20/21, 15:34 - +234 803 075 0650: Nothing other than it's a painful waste of my time! How many times will I tell you that?🤨🤨🤨

9/20/21, 16:54 - +234 803 075 0650: When the CBN focuses on accusing websites, BDCs of driving the run on the Naira and on cutting down trees instead of addressing the real issues - and some people genuinely think we should waste our time debating such inane things - one can only sit and watch
9/20/21, 16:57 - +234 802 474 1100: Egbe!! You hear what you want to hear 😂

The question you should ask yourself is do you think that the depreciation to 575 is aff ct by any fundamentals? 

I still don’t. It’s driven by fear! And as usual people get burnt when driven my fear in a speculative market.
9/20/21, 16:58 - +234 802 474 1100: Glad that you noted that a run is being made on the naira lord chris!!

9/20/21, 17:37 - +234 802 474 1100: If you can deal with bivariate and regression analysis - telling us the real issues with our exchange rate should not be a problem 🤨🤨
9/20/21, 17:38 - Kenneth Maths. US.: Yimu.....If you vex me too much I will opt for 100% forever sef then move go 9ja and work from there - earn in dollars and change at the rate ur brother "Meffy" is driving it up to🤣😅
9/20/21, 18:05 - +234 803 075 0650: no monetary authority he been able to maintain a fixed exchange rate, independent monetary policy and free movement of capital at the same time. It's not possible. So choosing to maintain a fixed exchange rate, you've decided to forgo free movement of foreign capital thus limiting the forex you can earn. That's at the root of Nigeria's fiscal crisis.Nigeria wants to copy countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar etc who are awash not only with oil but with foreign exchange to defend their local currencies for years to come.  Unfortunately it doesn't have their kind of foreign exchange and the facade it is creating will definitely fall of.
9/20/21, 18:06 - +234 803 075 0650: I have also told you of a country that chooses to liberalise its forex regime same time as we were facing challenges in 2016-2017 - Egypt. It's situation has greatly improved now, foreign exchange inflow has almost trippled and their currency is very stable.
9/20/21, 18:07 - +234 803 075 0650: we know what our problem is, we refuse to face it concentrating instead on inanities and you'll want me to come here debating CBN cutting tress and fighting websites and BDCs.... I refuse to reduce myself to such levels
9/20/21, 18:15 - +234 803 075 0650: And, of course, the only reason we refuse to liberalise the fx market is simply so as to continue to use it as a means of reward and accumulation. simple! All other reasons the government or CBN may provide has been empirically proven to be false or unworkable!
9/20/21, 18:34 - +234 803 075 0650: we kept shouting that the fx regime should be liberalised in 2015 when the Naira was 199 to the dollar. The government and CBN refused arguing the Naira will crash if the do. Now, the Naira has crashed to 575, yet we are still not getting any benefit. I put it to you that if we'd liberalised the Naira then or even in 2018 or 2019, the Naira wouldn't have crashed to 500
9/20/21, 18:34 - +234 803 075 0650: foreign capital is available and wants to come in but can't due to our dysfunctional fx regime
9/20/21, 18:35 - +234 802 474 1100: And now I know why we have been fundamentally on different sides of this conversation.

You talk about market structure which is good and all, but miss the fundamental problem facing commodity/oil dependent nations like us. *Forex earnings and Covid impact *

This is a demand and supply conversation. It is not a coïncidence that both crisis occurred in 2015 and now during times of global turmoil
9/20/21, 18:38 - +234 802 474 1100: This is false - patently : Foreign global capital pulled out of most markets and structure investments as a result of the poor performance of traditional instruments and chased moouth watering returns with Crypto, Gold and other trusted stores of value.
9/20/21, 18:39 - +234 802 474 1100: In 2020 and the crisis - these monies have not returned to prepandemic levels
9/20/21, 18:41 - +234 803 075 0650: You don't even know what you are talking about. Please study the case of Egypt and see how it squares with all these your faulty assumptions
9/20/21, 18:42 - +234 802 474 1100: I hear you on the FX regime and I must emphasize that I support a liberal FX regime. Always have,
9/20/21, 18:42 - +234 803 075 0650: Abeg, let's spare this group all these back and forth.
9/20/21, 18:42 - +234 802 474 1100: Take a look at South Africa and we can talk afterwards
9/20/21, 18:42 - +234 802 474 1100: Na you start am na😂
9/20/21, 19:13 - +234 802 474 1100: Btw— a liberalization does not protect your currency from devaluation : it only ensures it gets to its real value faster…

Quite faulty belief you have there on a floating FX rate.

But again you miss the fundamentals - your FX rate is a symptom not a disease. If you continue to have a huge trade deficit I.e imports consistently outstripping exports you will continue to need more Forex and thus continue to put pressure on the demand for your naira against the green back…..

The whole scope - Supply side challenge of Forex, the trend to Cryptos and P2P digital exchanges globally and the fact that remittances while great to the economy as inflow is not helpful if it comes through aforementioned channels.

Unfortunately articles like these don’t get enough readership because they are long and detailed 😀

But as I mentioned earlier - the run on the naira is squarely a demand - supply conversation at a time when the countries revenue is impacted by the global crisis.

I do not support Buhari or Emefiele - I have found myself always having to say this for some reason. I support Nigeria.

One thing I think the CBN and Emefiele needs is communication experts who help him connect with the Nigerian populace. Once a policy is out, you find people whose rent seeking businesses are hurt go out and sponsor/ inspire articles that paint Meffy like the devil and the policy as dead on arrival.

Take for example the 5nairA for dollar remittance. It was attacked in the public space, but then the same people go about to write about how remittance is low and blah blah.

Finally my people, the bottle is half full, not half empty. Long live Nigeria
9/21/21, 10:27 - +234 803 072 5702: I'm in a class at LBS now and our prof is talking about CBN and forex...i just wished Eugene and Chris were here😁...
9/21/21, 10:29 - +234 803 072 5702: <Media omitted>
9/21/21, 10:45 - Dee: Just kuku say you want the class to end.
9/21/21, 11:00 - +234 803 075 0650: From the title of the article I can never read such rubbish, shifting responsibility from where it truly belongs to people who are only reacting to bad times and trying to secure their savings. Rubbish again!!!!!
9/21/21, 11:07 - Dee: To be honest, that article isn't bad. It is long yes. But isn't as bad as you think. Just read it. Objectively.
9/21/21, 11:28 - +234 803 075 0650: Sorry, I'm not reading for entertainment. once the unit of analysis is wrong, everything is wrong. It's people like him and Fela Durutoye that will be sponsored by APC to contest for presidency just to depress and balkanize Southern and the youth votes - and they will be making inane but entertaining arguments which people actually follow & listen to. I don't do that. I have better things to do with my time
9/21/21, 11:29 - Dee: 😀 Chai!
9/21/21, 11:31 - +234 803 075 0650: You people can be reading o. But I'll never going to read any rubbish that guy writes. He's just a bloody jobber!
9/21/21, 11:49 - +234 803 075 0650: People like Tope, Fela Durutoye, Dele Momodu (who bag of dollars was delivered cash to him at ovation office to defray his cost of constesting for presidency in 2011), Sowore, Femi Fani Kayode......people I have first hand evidence of double dealings against, I will never in my life take them or anything they write seriously. In fact, you'll never catch me reading any rubbish they write. I'm not that jobless!!!!!
9/21/21, 11:54 - +234 803 075 0650: Every currency operates on trust. Once that trust is destroyed, people withdraw their trust. We've seen it in Zimbabwe, in Venezuela, in many places really. That's what's happening in Nigeria currently. No one trust the Naira, not even those managing it. To now expect people to sit by and watch all their assets and savings evaporate is criminal. To blame them for taking steps to secure their assets is the height of stupidity. That's what he's using sophistry to make you believe
9/21/21, 11:57 - +234 803 075 0650: Even Dangote made rich by the Nigerian state, has seen his assets greatly diminished by the collapse of the Naira and he is also taking steps to convert most of his assets to dollars
9/21/21, 12:00 - +234 803 075 0650: I was at a private event in 2017 where Dangote told us that with the rate of management of the Naira, it will get to 1000/$. I'll never forget that day, although it was strictly off the records.
9/21/21, 12:02 - +234 803 075 0650: They'll now send some useless fellow in their paybook to entertain us and you actually expect me to read it😏
9/21/21, 12:15 - +234 803 075 0650: So, if Dangote believes over 4 years ago that the Naira is going to 1000/$ and all his associates and close friend too - and they are all taking positions to protect their assets, is it now the poor man on the street that is taking a very late step that we're now blaming?
9/21/21, 12:39 - +234 802 474 1100: I tried to save you Chris! 
I really tried 😂😂
9/21/21, 12:44 - +234 802 474 1100: You seem to be fixated on who to blame 😂. Buhari, Emefiele, every Nigerian leader. Yes they are all to blame. 

But in the end we all are. I mentioned that in our own country, we as Nigerians have 20bn dollars in Forex that we are looking for, sitting in our dorm accounts. If you don’t see the irony in that position, I can’t help you.

And as usual here is my disclaimer: I don’t support Buhari, I don’t support Emefiele
9/21/21, 12:45 - Dee: @2348030750650 the guy actually agreed with some of the things you are saying. But he made valid arguments all round 

Just pretend it wasn't Eugene that posted it and read it. You may like some parts there.

9/21/21, 12:46 - +234 802 474 1100: Smarto who be he facilitator Biko —- lemme know if he is for or against Chris😂😂😂
9/21/21, 12:47 - Benedict: Dont we need to identify who is to blame so we can fix the issues? 🤷‍♂️
9/21/21, 12:47 - +234 803 072 5702: Orolugbagbe Isaac
9/21/21, 12:56 - +234 802 474 1100: We all are!

You who is earning in dollars and not investing it in Nigeria 😀
9/21/21, 12:56 - +234 802 474 1100: That one na Chris guy na! He dislikes Buhari to the core. But he is also a pragmatist… He has been an MD of a multinational, entrepreneur and academic… so quite balanced.

Can you share his thoughts?
9/21/21, 13:01 - +234 803 072 5702: Lol...i don't think he hates Buhari o. He's a strategy man from what i''ve seen/heard so far and he's just applying simple strategy to the whole fx issue. His submission is that you can't have a humongous negative current account balance and be borrowing with impunity for recurrent expenditure without expecting it to aversely impact exchange rate.

But you see, if it's opinions from Tope, Fela Durotoye, Dele Momodu, Sowore, FFK and their likes, I'm absolutely not interested. If you like reading them, good for you. I'll rather I spend that time reading some incisive comments and analysis from other experts on other topics. I'm not interested in reading their opinions. Simple!!!!

9/23/21, 12:52 - +234 803 075 0650: Fare thee well Dr Mailafia

Christopher Akor

We were all shocked by the news of the demise of Dr Obadiah Mailafia, Nigeria’s foremost public intellectual, academic, central banker, national and international public servant and lately, a voice against the low-key genocide against the minorities of the north central states. He was said to have developed malaria-like symptoms (but not Covid-19 because he was fully vaccinated, and tests showed he was negative) about a week ago and was taken to the hospital. He never recovered and was pronounced dead, Sunday morning at the University of Abuja teaching hospital in Gwagwalada. Insinuations from his family suggest he was so shabbily treated by the hospitals he was taken to and it was as if they were there to supervise his demise rather than treat him.

Born 64 years ago, Dr Mailafia quickly distinguished himself by graduating top of his class at the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria. After working at his Alma mater for some time, he won a federal government scholarship to France to study Economics and Public Administration. He subsequently proceeded to Oriel College at Oxford where he bagged a DPhil in Economics in 1995.

He taught at various British universities until 2001 when he moved to the African Development Bank where he served as Chief Economist and supervised many projects in agriculture, infrastructure, power and education. He was reputed to have drafted the concept note that was later adopted by the board of the AfDB, leading to the establishment of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), an exclusively African peer to peer mechanism for holding leaders accountable to help reduce poverty, empower women and put Africa on a sustainable path to development. Sadly, like everything African, after the initial fanfare that greeted its launch and after some tepid attempts to hold leaders accountable, the mechanism has all but disintegrated as sit-tight leaders have shown no appetite for accountability.

In 2005, the Obasanjo administration recalled him from the AfDB to serve as deputy governor of the Central Bank in charge of economic policy, where he oversaw monetary policy, economic policy, research and statistics and liaison with regional and international institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. He was on the team that worked to successfully negotiate Nigeria away from its debts to the Paris Club in 2006.

Of course, the moment Obasanjo left in 2007, the rapid Nigerian malaise that often frustrates brilliant and honest people from serving in the public sector set in leading to his exit from the bank in 2007.  He was soon back to his international forte, serving as the Chief of Staff to the 79-member nation of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group based in Brussels, where has was involved in the management of €22 billion of EU funding for ACP countries under the 10th European Development Fund (EDF) and €31.5 billion for the 11th European Development Fund covering the years 2015–2020. 

He was on the board of several companies and advised hedge funds, international and private equity funds and investors on emerging markets risks and opportunities. This is besides his role as a newspaper columnist to several media houses in Nigeria, a public intellectual and radio/TV commentator.

I only got to know Dr Mailafia personally in 2016 when I was working as his Editor for his incisive Monday, later Friday, column “Wealth of Nations” in BusinessDay. It was a delight to always read his thoroughly researched, incisive and deeply intellectual pieces every week. I’m always at a loss as to how he is able to combine research for his articles and his other public and international engagements and still churn out excellent pieces every week not only for BusinessDay but also for other outlets. It wasn’t long before we developed a personal relationship where he became like a mentor, urging me to improve my craft. It was also there I saw first-hand the vile nature of our public institutions always at war with honest and brilliant individuals who dare to call attention to the wanton corruption and mismanagement of our common patrimony. On more than one occasion, the CBN – the same institution he served with so much distinction – will write inane hack pieces with fictitious names in response to his critique of our monetary or fiscal policies and use their patronage powers to force it on journalists to give their hack pieces “urgent and wide publicity”.

It wasn’t long before Dr Mailafia began to butt heads with the Buhari administration not so much for its catastrophic mismanagement of the economy but for a totally different reason – the low-key genocide being perpetrated against ethnic minorities in the north central states of Platueau, Nassarawa, Gombe, Kaduna and Benue states by so-called Fulani herdsmen who are never identified, arrested or made to pay for their crimes. Besides his very public advocacy, Dr Mailafia actively collaborated in a series of research that systematically documented the thousands of people lost to the herdsmen genocide and the role of the Buhari government in silently encouraging and covering up the killings. That report by the International Committee on Nigeria: “Nigeria Silent Slaughter: Genocide in Nigeria and the Implications for the International Community” made it to the highest echelon of the international community and is the basis of renewed pressure by Western countries on the Buhari administration to put a stop to the killings.

That made Dr Mailafia a hated and marked man. Besides being hounded all the time by the Department of State Services (DSS) there were many futile attempts to question his integrity by trying to rope him into decisions taken at the CBN when he was deputy governor, but which was not under his remit. Most recently, he has had to be moving from one place to another to evade security forces and hoodlums sent to intimate or assassinate him.

What I could not understand however, was his decision not to go on a brief exile considering the forces arrayed against him. He could have been infinitely more useful to the people and the cause he was fighting for being alive. But a defiant Mailafia declared in 2020 that he was prepared to die for Nigeria and the struggle to liberate his people. That is exactly how he went, being a victim of Nigeria’s decrepit healthcare system that kills rather than treats.  Adieu to a mentor, an intellectual giant, an international polymath, an honest and decent human being and a man who deeply cares for his people and the fate of his country and the African continent!

9/30/21, 12:45 - +234 802 474 1100: Hmmmmm. Nigeria is bad. Nigeria is tough. No security. Poverty capital of the world. PMB is old. GEJ is corrupt. FX is high etc etc. Yet within a year 5 (FIVE) Unicorns ( Interswitch, Flutterwave, Paystack, Opay and now Andela) have come out of Nigeria, with another one or two to be announced before the end of year. 

Pls better stop the complaints and find your own feet in the market according to the news below extracted and adapted from TechCabal https://bit.ly/3mgikFl

‘Andela just became Nigeria’s fifth unicorn!

‘The company, which connects African software engineering talents to global employers, has just secured $200 million at a $1.5 billion valuation in a Series E funding round led by Softbank. 

Remind me, what's a unicorn? 

A unicorn is any private startup company valued at $1 billion or more. In Africa, there are presently five unicorns including Interswitch, Flutterwave, OPay, and Wave, the last three achieving the status only this year.

Backstory

With a 0.7 acceptance rate, you’d have an easier time getting into Harvard than you would Andela. 

Launched in Nigeria in 2014, Andela started as an Africa-focused software developer training and outsourcing company. With time, it grew to become a premier source for talented, well-rounded developers in Africa thanks to its curriculum and training methods.

Marked by Facebook 

Two years after launch, Andela got a $24 million infusion, led by Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, who followed up with a visit.

Much later, in 2020, the company became fully remote and closed its physical offices in Lagos, Uganda, and Rwanda. At the time, Andela wanted to break geographical limits and increase the number of African applicants who could apply to work with the company.

This decision turned out to be perfect as it helped the company launch into Latin and South America to explore the talent there. 

Zoom out: Today, Andela boasts of a network of engineers from more than 80 countries and six continents. Through Andela, thousands of engineers have been placed with leading technology companies including Github, Cloudflare, and ViacomCBS. With its new funding, the company aims to grow its talent pool and help connect even more Africans to global opportunities.’

Dangote will open probably the largest refinery in the world this year with NNPC begging him with US$3B to buy minor percentage share. 

Nollywood King of the boys etc hitting it massively on Netflix and the musicians nominated for Grammys. 
Kuda microfinance bank startup valued at US$500m!

SoftBank, one of the world’s largest funds made two HUGE beta on Nigeria within 6 months ( Opay and Andela) Visa, MasterCard, Atack, Facebook, Google etc all pouring money into the startup ecosystem in Nigeria In droves…

Pls spare me your belly aching on Nigeria so I can understand what these guys see in Nigeria that I'm not seeing. 🏃🏿‍♂️🏃🏿‍♂️🏃🏿‍♂️🏃🏿‍♂️🏃🏿‍♂️🏃🏿‍♂️

9/30/21, 13:43 - +234 803 075 0650: ANC and the mismanagement of South Africa

Christopher Akor

Political parties are indispensable for the smooth functioning of democracy.  Besides being vehicles for aggregation of interests and seeking political power, political parties perform the very important function of political communication and education of the citizenry. What is more, a strong party system ensures that the parties moderate contest for power amongst its members. So central is the political party to democracy that the late American Political Scientist, Elmer Schattschneider boldly proclaimed that “democracy is unthinkable save in terms of parties.” This is more so in a parliamentary system where the lines between the party and government are usually blurred and absolute party discipline and unity is needed for a smooth functioning of the government.

Sadly, in Africa, parties are perhaps the weakest link in the democratic value chain. In many African countries, parties serve only as vehicles for capturing power and nothing more. Politics is often based on personalities and not on parties, making the party virtually redundant. That is why in Kenya, for instance, new parties are formed every election cycle and they all wither away after the elections.

Sadly, the African National Congress (ANC), Africa’s oldest, most cohesive and foremost liberation organization and political organization has been showing signs of decay lately. This is principally because its leaders and operatives are more concerned with primitive accumulation than strengthening the party and democracy in South Africa.

Recently, it emerged that the ANC is broke and unable to pay staff salaries regularly. While the party claims it was due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, workers of the party say it has been so for years. Also, the ANC itself admitted to not remitting the personal income tax of its workers it has been deducting to the South African Revenue Service (SARS), a clear violation of the law. However, the full picture of the disorganization of the party emerged late last month when the party couldn’t register many of its candidates for the local elections due in November with the electoral commission before the deadline. The excuse that it was caused by a glitch in the electoral commission’s system couldn’t fly because other parties registered their candidates without problems. The very independent(?) electoral commission had to extend the deadline of registration before the ANC was able to register all its candidates.

The ANC – the party of the venerable Nelson Mandela and anti-apartheid freedom fighters, many of whom gave their lives for the liberation of black South Africans – has completely squandered the opportunity to remake South Africa and has damaged its political and moral authority in so short a time.

Upon vanquishing apartheid and capturing power in 1994, the party was supposed to use the power of the state to improve the fortunes of majority black South Africans who have been under the oppressive yoke of apartheid for so long. But, typical of most African liberation movements and political parties, upon ascending to power, some ANC apparatchiks prioritized accumulation of personal wealth over the welfare of its people. The ANC is now a by-word for monumental corruption, outright theft, cronyism and patronage.

This got to a height during the disastrous nine-year presidency of Jacob Zuma. Zuma’s tenure was marked by many governance and corruption scandals including the Nkandala, state capture by the Gupta family, and political cronyism. According to the Mail & Guardian, an “estimated $35 billion was looted from the state” while “institutions like the state airline, railway and tax agencies were wrecked” during Zuma’s reign alone.

That is why the vote margins of the ANC have been steadily reducing since 1994 when it won the elections with a 62 percent of the vote. Its winning margins are now trending around the lower 50s. At the 2016 regional elections, for instance, the ANC lost Port Elizabeth municipality – renamed Nelson Mandela Bay – to the Democratic Alliance, a previously white dominated party, which is now appealing to a lot of South Africans because of its history of solid governance. The loss of Nelson Mandela Bay - a key ANC stronghold – to the DA came to many as a shock despite the virulent ANC campaign there invoking anti-apartheid messages.

The ANC only marginally increased its vote margin to 57.5% at the 2019 general elections after ousting Zuma as president and following repeated apologies and promises by its new leader, Cyril Ramaphosa, a Mandela protégé, to tackle corruption and return the ANC to the path of good governance.

Sadly, those promises are not being fulfilled as he is being virtually sabotaged by Zuma loyalists in the party who are even threatening to oust him from the leadership of the party – and the presidency eventually. To show the rot at the party, the current secretary general of the ANC, Ace Magashule, a Zuma loyalist, is currently suspended and facing charges of corruption relating to his tenure as premier of the Free State province – the province where the ANC was founded.

I have always argued that the problem of South African democracy and the African National Congress is one of lack of competition. Due to the unique history of the country, black South Africans are so emotionally attached to the ANC because of its over 80 years of dogged fight against racism and apartheid. The official opposition, the Democratic Alliance, the former White party, is still in denial of its racial past and race as a means of organization. The other party – the Economic Freedom Fighters of Julius Malema, the former youth leader of the ANC – is known more for trouble making, monumental corruption and shady dealings of its leadership. For as long as South Africa remains without a viable alternative to the ANC, so long will the ANC’s gross impunity, abuse of power and privileges continue.
