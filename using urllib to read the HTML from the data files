# In this assignment you will write a Python program that expands on
# http://www.py4e.com/code3/urllinks.py.
# The program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below,
# extract the href= values from the anchor tags,
# scan for a tag that is in a particular position relative to the first name in the list,
# follow that link and repeat the process a number of times and report the last name you find.
#
# We provide two files for this assignment.
# One is a sample file where we give you the name for your testing
# and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment
#
# Sample problem:
# Start at http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Fikret.html
# Find the link at position 3 (the first name is 1).
# Follow that link. Repeat this process 4 times.
# The answer is the last name that you retrieve.
#
# Sequence of names: Fikret Montgomery Mhairade Butchi Anayah
# Last name in sequence: Anayah
#
# Actual problem: Start at: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Darrell.html
# Find the link at position 18 (the first name is 1).
# Follow that link. Repeat this process 7 times.
# The answer is the last name that you retrieve.
# Hint: The first character of the name of the last page that you will load is: A
#
# Strategy
# The web pages tweak the height between the links
# and hide the page after a few seconds
# to make it difficult for you to do the assignment without writing a Python program.
# But frankly with a little effort and patience,
# you can overcome these attempts to make it a little harder to complete the assignment
# without writing a Python program.
# But that is not the point. The point is to write a clever Python program to solve the program.
#
# Sample execution
#
# Here is a sample execution of a solution:
#
# $ python3 solution.py
# Enter URL: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/known_by_Fikret.html
# Enter count: 4
# Enter position: 3
